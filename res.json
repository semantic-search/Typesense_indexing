All 5 of them sit around the table and pick up the chopstick placed towards their right. But, here\u2019s the problem. To eat the spaghetti they need both the chopsticks and since everyone picked up the chopstick to their right, nobody gets the left chopstick and hence, nobody can eat. Logically thinking, this problem isn\u2019t really a problem in real life scenario. The philosophers could have asked for a few extra pairs of chopsticks, or they could have eaten using their hands \ud83d\ude02 . Jokes apart, but the dining philosophers problem is an excellent example to explain the concept of deadlock while resource sharing in OS. Consider the philosophers to be processes and the chopsticks to be a shared resource. Every process needs two resources out of which one it has already acquired and the other is acquired by some other process. Till the other process does not free the resource, this process cannot proceed. Similarly, the other process is dependent on another process for its resource. Since every process is dependent on each other, it forms a circular-wait and the system goes into a deadlock condition. Here, when each philosopher picks up the chopstick to their right, they also end up picking the left chopstick of the person sitting next to them which leaves every philosopher with just one chopstick and nobody can start eating. To solve this problem, we can use this strategy: Consider five philosophers: P0,P1,P2,P3,P4 & five chopsticks: C0,C1,C2,C3,C4 Initially we let P0 enter into the dining room. Since nobody else is present there all the chopsticks are free and P0 acquires chopsticks C0 and C1 and starts eating. ![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/58/1*o5O5AL2Fsxav-v4pL8RKwQ.png?q=20) ![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/1738/1*o5O5AL2Fsxav-v4pL8RKwQ.png) Now, P1 enters the room. Since P0 is already eating, chopstick C1 is not available for P1 and hence P1 cannot eat and is kept waiting. PS : Since P1 does not get C1, it doesn\u2019t claim C2. ![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/56/1*5uSCZhqqrEAVPm0Anr- rnA.png?q=20) ![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/1738/1*5uSCZhqqrEAVPm0Anr- rnA.png) Next, P2 enters the room. Since C2 and C3 both are available, P2 starts eating. ![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/56/1*Do6ZdUhF4MA5rBn- TMRzkQ.png?q=20) ![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/1738/1*Do6ZdUhF4MA5rBn- TMRzkQ.png) Next, P3 enters and is blocked and added to the waiting queue because C3 is not available. ![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/58/1*iVFy- aNsNppBK03Zpm440Q.png?q=20) ![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/1762/1*iVFy- aNsNppBK03Zpm440Q.png) Similarly P4 is blocked and is added to the waiting queue as C0 is not available ![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/58/1*IbopZTs2dgDzr_8wu8DiJA.png?q=20) ![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/1762/1*IbopZTs2dgDzr_8wu8DiJA.png) Now, consider P0 has finished eating and the resources claimed by it i.e. C0 and C1 are released. P1 cannot start eating since C2 is still not released and hence P4 starts eating since C4 and C0 both are released. Hence, ![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/58/1*pLhNwqHUNTPjvUDcVOkUoQ.png?q=20) ![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/1762/1*pLhNwqHUNTPjvUDcVOkUoQ.png) If now P2 releases the chopsticks C2 and C3, philosopher P1 can start eating P3 has to stay in the waiting queue since chopstick C4 is not available. ![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*QQWSQzF9IKIYtgWixYeZbQ.png?q=20) ![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/1878/1*QQWSQzF9IKIYtgWixYeZbQ.png) Finally, consider that philosopher P4 has finished eating and has freed chopsticks C0 and C4, P3 can start eating. ![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/58/1*SUb4il9kXjSehbxPrsQ0cw.png?q=20) ![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/1784/1*SUb4il9kXjSehbxPrsQ0cw.png) This is the strategy using which we have ensured that all the philosophers have been served and avoided the circular wait situation. This is the logic behind the solution of the dining philosophers problem. Here is the C program designed to solve the problem:- _(I\u2019ve used semaphores to solve this problem. For more information on semaphores, refer this website-)_ ## Semaphores ### Semaphores are a programming construct designed by E. W. Dijkstra in the late 1960s.

The API also returns revealing auth failure info (invalid email/bad password). This creates a perfect setup to exploit via brute force attacks. We\u2019ve been using Google Firebase for the past year at Eureka Surveys and have had a fantastic experience with the product. Firebase\u2019s Firestore database and Cloud Functions have scaled smoothly as we\u2019ve gone from zero to hundreds of thousands of users. We\u2019re a team of two full-time engineers, and Firebase has been the perfect substitute for having to hire a full infrastructure team. After seeing a lot of success on iOS (100K+ Ratings, 4.8 Star Average), we launched Eureka\u2019s website (eurekasurveys.com) in August of 2020. We were hit almost immediately with a wave of attacks. Specifically, one such brute-force attack exploiting Firebase Auth allowed hackers from Nigeria to log in to several user accounts and drain funds to a hacker-controlled PayPal. Google has yet to come out with a permanent fix. **As of October 2020, any website using Google Firebase Auth with email and password login is vulnerable to this sort of attack**. We\u2019ve confirmed this through white-hat attacks on several other sites that use Google Firebase Auth (with permission, of course). # Steps to Reproduce 1. Attacker obtains black market list of millions of leaked emails and passwords. The number of leaked passwords in our industry (paid surveys) is especially high. 2. Attacker visits website backed by Firebase Auth and grabs the site\u2019s public API key from the network call to https://securetoken.googleapis.com/v1/token. Firebase Auth calls secureToken on every request to exchange an Auth token for a refresh token. ![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*g-sQpPiup_Pr_xRL6ggwZQ.png?q=20) ![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/1262/1*g-sQpPiup_Pr_xRL6ggwZQ.png) 3 . Attacker uses site\u2019s public API key to access Google Identity Toolkit API, the underlying service that backs Firebase Auth. The attacker then brute forces email-password combinations using the _SignInWithPassword_ method (used to validate login credentials) via the following command: > curl > \u2018https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com/v1/accounts:signInWithPassword?key=[API_KEY]' > -H \u2018Content-Type: application/json\u2019 \u2014 data-binary > \u2018{\u201cemail\u201d:\u201d[EMAIL]\u201d,\u201dpassword\u201d:\u201d[PASSWORD]\u201d,\u201dreturnSecureToken\u201d:true}\u2019 \u2014 > referer [URL] We saw _SignInWithPassword_ being hit at rates of 5,500 requests per minute, with a peak of **90,000 requests per minute**. ![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Qa0TsyJ6izYG_u5Lp- ZgJA.png?q=20) ![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/2288/1*Qa0TsyJ6izYG_u5Lp- ZgJA.png) 4 . Most calls to _SignInWithPassword_ fail with either EMAIL_NOT_FOUND or INVALID_PASSWORD, but given our large user base, **the attacker saw success once every four to six hours**. For every validated email-password login, the attacker would then access that user\u2019s account via our website and drain their entire Eureka balance to PayPal. Even as of October 2020, our Google Identity Toolkit API is still being spammed with thousands of calls to _SignInWithPassword_ every minute. # **Solution (Workaround)** Without a permanent fix from Google, the best we can do is stall the attackers. We\u2019ve come up with two workarounds that have so far, prevented any new account compromises: 1. Turn off Firebase Auth sign in with password and only allow sign in through email link. An attacker will still able to check email-password combinations using the Google Identity Toolkit API, but will be unable to log in. The exception to this is if a user uses their same Eureka email and password for their email provider, in which case the attacker has access to the user\u2019s email, and thus their sign-in link. 2. Turn down quota limits in the Google Identity Toolkit Console. Google Identity Toolkit is sneakily automatically set up when using Firebase Auth \u2014 we were initially unaware the Identity Toolkit API was even exposed. **The default quota value for Google Identity Toolkit API is 30,000 requests per minute per user** , where a user is uniquely identified by IP address. Normal user behavior should not require more than five requests per minute per user. # Recommendations to Google We included the following recommendations to Google in our Bug Bounty report: 1. Change the default quota values for Google Identity Toolkit API to something more reasonable. 30,000 requests per minute per user is not necessary. 2. Block IPs with high error rates. Attackers hit our project from a rotating set of IPs to circumvent rate limits, but with error rates of above 99.9%. Google Identity Toolkit API ought to be smart enough to ban requests from these users. ![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Q6AkQiWpaAlaXzsd52KOJA.png?q=20) ![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/2180/1*Q6AkQiWpaAlaXzsd52KOJA.png) **TL;DR** Firebase Auth has high default quota limits and enables Google identity services without opt in. The API also returns revealing auth failure info (invalid email/bad password). This creates a perfect setup to exploit via brute force attacks. We hope this write-up helps other projects using Firebase Auth protect themselves from this sort of brute force attack. Questions or comments?

In this short article, I want to show you how I made this single div logo just using CSS. Feel free to create a pen over on CodePen and follow along! ![Screen Shot 2020-10-23 at 8.12.25 AM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603458755964/_G_BNq6Ye.png?auto=format&q=60) ### Getting Started Before we jump into any code, check out Mihai Dolganiuc on Dribbble - the logo we're building is based off one in his collection. The first thing that I like to do when creating a new pen is define the colors I'll be using, set a nice background color and center my canvas. I'm using SCSS in this example, but you could use CSS variables if you'd like. $background: #ebf5fc; $light-blue: #00cdfc; $dark-blue: #007fe8; body { display: flex; min-height: 100vh; justify-content: center; align-items: center; background: $background; } This gives us a nice off-white color and ensures that any markup we add (coming up next) will be centered on the screen. Alright! Let's add our single div to the HTML. I'll apply a class name of `logo` so we can target that in our CSS. <div class=\"logo\"></div> ### Thinking Through the Problem Now comes the fun part. The only way I can think of easily achieving this effect is by using a Pseudo-Element. A Pseudo-Element allow you to style specific parts of an element. While there are many Pseudo-Element selectors, the `::before` selector will allow us to add content before an element. In our case, we can utilize the `::before` selector to layer the rounded-square on top of the blue circle. ### Putting It All Together Now that we have a solution, let's start to put everything together. Let's start with the blue circle. .logo { width: 150px; height: 150px; border-radius: 50%; // 1 background: linear-gradient(to bottom left, $dark-blue 15%, $light-blue); // 2 position: relative; } There are a few important things here that I want to point out. 1. We use a linear-gradient to fill the circle. This gives us a nice fade between the darker blue and the lighter blue. The 15% will start the darker-blue further into the gradient, giving it a more dominant appearance. 2. Because we're going to use a Pseudo-Element for the rounded-square, we need to ensure that we can position that element based off of the position of the circle. That's why we use `position: relative` here. The CSS above gives us the follow result: ![Screen Shot 2020-10-23 at 8.38.11 AM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603460299247/jWMaaLKhi.png?auto=format&q=60) Now that the easy part is out of the way, let's start to work on the rounded- square. First, target the `::before` selector. Because I'm using SCSS, I can nest this selector inside my class selector. .logo { ... &::before { } } The `::before` selector won't do anything as-is; we need to set the content, position, background and size of the element first. &::before { // 1 content: \"\"; // 2 position: absolute; // 3 bottom: 60px; left: 60px; width: 150px; height: 150px; background: #ea2f98; } 1. Because we're using the `::before` selector, we need to include the `content` property. This property is used to add content to the element, and in our case, we just set it equal to an empty string. If the `content` property is excluded from this rule, the element won't show up at all. 2. Because we set the circle's `position` to `relative` we can now position this rounded-square based off of the circle by setting `position: absolute` here. 3. We move this element 60px from the bottom and 60px from the left of the blue circle. ![Screen Shot 2020-10-23 at 8.50.00 AM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603461025396/bRANYQ- _p.png?auto=format&q=60) It's starting to get there - very nice! Let's get those rounded corners in there and get that stroke effect by using a border. &::before { ... border-radius: 60px; border: 12px solid $background; } ![Screen Shot 2020-10-23 at 8.51.56 AM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603461125456/qk- jdxCE8.png?auto=format&q=60) At this point, we've pretty much achieved the desired effect. The last major step is to apply the gradient. Revisit the `background` property and use a linear-gradient instead of the pink color. In order for the blue circle to show through the rounded-square, we need to have the bottom-left of the square be slightly translucent. We achieve this by using `rgba()` and setting the alpha to `0.8`. &::before { ... background: linear-gradient( to bottom left, rgba(249, 180, 70, 1) 15%, rgba(234, 47, 152, 0.8) ); ... } ![Screen Shot 2020-10-23 at 9.02.57 AM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603461784260/n__q1kFpX.png?auto=format&q=60) Because we're using a Pseudo-Element and are offsetting it from the circle, the entire logo is now off-center. To fix this, we can simply go back to the `.logo` rule and add some margin. .logo { margin: 100px 100px 0 0; ... } ![Screen Shot 2020-10-23 at 9.05.19 AM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603461932717/nUqEYN8MP.png?auto=format&q=60) ### Conclusion There we go - we've created a single div logo with the assistance of a Pseduo- Element and some gradients! It really wasn't that difficult was it? Here's the final result: See the Pen Single Div Logo by Braydon Coyer (@braydoncoyer) on CodePen.

In the ten years since, much related work has been done, mainly in the areas of public awareness, advocacy, policy, networking and implementation, with some impressive results. The year 2002, with Rio + 10 and the International Year of Mountains (IYM2002), now presents us with a dual challenge with regard to sustainable development and the cause of mountain regions at different levels: Let us focus first on the sectoral level. In each of the last five years we have prepared a publication addressing one of the main topics on the meeting agenda of the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD). These thematic brochures have focused on links between the sectoral topics on the CSD agenda and the main features of sustainable development in mountain regions. In other words, we designed these brochures which dealt with water, tourism, forestry, transport and energy to relate these sectoral topics and strategies to mountain regions. Over the course of these years, we realised that not only the sectoral level but also the national level has a crucial role to play. Each country needs to define its own framework for sustainable mountain development and related policies, laws and instruments based on its understanding of mountain regions and their role in national development. Our own history has taught us that sustainable development in mountain regions is a lengthy political, social and economic process that extends over decades and moves forward step-by-step sometimes two steps forward and one step back. This process has allowed all segments and groups in the population a chance to engage in debate and discussion, as well as in decision-making procedures. Over time, this process creates the elements and instruments of a framework that permits implementation of sustainable development in mountain regions, as well as improvements in the standard of living of mountain populations. Hence the present publication focuses on the framework and instruments needed for sustainable mountain development at the national level. It follows the pattern established in previous thematic brochures. First an overview of the topic and its main aspects is presented. This is followed by case studies that illustrate specific instruments and policies in many different countries of the world. The brochure concludes with a presentation of concrete recommendations, issues and conclusions relevant to all of us who are ready to commit ourselves to advancing the cause of sustainable development in mountain regions. Finally, let us return to the global level. At this level we intend to meet regularly in future in order to make common efforts to promote sustainable development and improvement of livelihoods in mountain regions. Hence we intend to create a basis for different types of partnerships in order to exchange experience, undertake joint efforts, and make common commitments. This is the aim of the \"International Partnership for Sustainable Development in Mountain Regions\" that was agreed upon at the preparatory meeting in Bali and is to be launched at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg. This partnership will be further debated and discussed, and given operational and concrete shape, at the Bishkek Global Mountain Summit. Dear readers: let us seize the opportunity at hand and accept the dual challenge of 2002. Let us foster the conditions for sustainable mountain development at the national level and commit ourselves to the International Partnership for Sustainable Development in Mountain Regions at the global level. Thus we will be acting locally and networking globally. And finally, let us remember that friendships and partnerships inspire people and therefore promote the cause of development.

Lutz) Why policies and instruments for mountain development ? Mountains cover a significant portion of the land area of many countries in the world, and their resources are playing an increasingly crucial role in sustainable development. But the specific challenges of development in mountains are rarely reflected in national policies. Only a few countries have adopted coherent policies that address these challenges from a mountain perspective. The present publication advances the idea of policy initiatives for sustainable development of mountain areas and provides visions and principles that could help elaborate such initiatives. It presents case studies from mountain areas around the world that illustrate promising examples of mountain development. Mountains play a key role in sustainable development, and their importance will increase in future. As water towers of the world, mountains will play a crucial role in providing fresh water for a growing number of people, for industrial development, and for agriculture and irrigation in mountains and downstream areas. Food security, poverty alleviation, and, ultimately, political stability will thus be critically linked to mountain resources, and hence to the development taking place in mountain areas. Mountains will also continue to play an important role as hotspots of biodiversity. Increasing urbanisation within mountains will put additional stress on scarce resources such as water. At the same time, mountains are characterised by specific development challenges. Typically, these include difficult access, economic and political marginality, outmigration, environmental sensitivity, diversity of livelihoods, and cultural diversity. These challenges need to be addressed by specific policies, laws, and institutional arrangements at the international, national, and local levels. From Rio to Johannesburg At the global level, the adoption of Chapter 13 of Agenda 21 (Rio 1992) was a milestone in achieving recognition of the specific challenges of sustainable development in mountain areas. Chapter 13 also recognised that mountain areas experience rapid socio-economic and cultural transformation coupled with environmental degradation, and that special efforts would be needed to address these problems. A significant number of countries have realised the importance of mountain What do China, Eritrea, and Costa Rica have in common with the United States, Austria, Afghanistan, Russia, and New Zealand? In these countries, as in 91 other countries of the world, mountains cover a significant portion of the land area over 25%. In the remaining 101 countries of the world, mountains cover less than 25% of the land area, but often play an important role based on resources such as water, minerals, or forests (see map on pages 2829). Why policies and instruments for mountain development ? 5 2002 a year of opportunity for the promotion of mountain development The year 2002, celebrating both the International Year of Mountains (IYM2002) and the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD2002) in Johannesburg, presents a unique opportunity for policy initiatives to support mountain development. resources for sustainable development. They have formulated policies and laws in specific sectors such as watershed management, forestry, tourism, energy, transport and infrastructure development. However, most of these policies were elaborated from a downstream perspective. They perceive mountains as \"hinterlands\" that supply specific resources needed by the national economy and society. Typically, they disregard mountain livelihoods and local development agendas and fail to consider the specific challenges of mountain development. What is needed, therefore, are policy initiatives and instruments for mountain development, that recognise mountain areas as equal partners in development, consider the specific challenges of develop- ment in mountain areas, and ensure that sectoral policies are adapted to take account of this specificity. A key role for national policies and international partnerships In the contemporary world, authority for the formulation of policies and laws rests largely with individual countries. Therefore, policies and instruments concerned with the development of mountain areas must be elaborated and translated into action primarily at the national level. Such policies and instruments will provide orientation and coherence for laws and regulations, and for programmes at the local level. National policies can be effectively supported by international partnerships for mountain development. The purpose of the present publication In its opening section, this publication presents ideas and principles that could help elab- orate national policies, initiatives, and instruments (pages 619). Next, regional case studies (pages 2049) from mountain areas around the world present concrete examples of the many different ways these principles have been incorporated into policies and policy frameworks. The final section (pages 5054) provides an outline of how policies and instruments for mountain development could be initiated and institutionalised, and suggests where linkages are possible with international partnerships. A map showing the main mountain areas of the world by country can be found on pages 2829. Some key terms The following terms are used in this publication in reference to mountain areas and development at different spatial levels: Global refers to the whole world Regional refers to several countries National refers to one country Subnational refers to parts of a country, such as a province, district, or national watershed Local refers to specific localities, valleys, or other sub-national areas Remote valleys that are difficult to access: North West Frontier Province, Pakistan. (P. Walther) 6 Sustainable Development in Mountain Areas In Scotland, an altitude of 240 m above sea level is sufficient to classify an area as mountainous. (T. Kohler) Key issues, principles and strategies Recognition of mountains as important and specific areas of development Development of mountain areas is often shaped by decisions taken in political and economic centres in lowland areas. The interests behind these decisions are short-term rather than long-term, and extraction of resources takes precedence over the sustainable development of mountain areas. To end political and economic marginalisation, mountain areas need to be recognised as equal partners in development. Strategies to achieve this goal include decentralisation, local institution building, recognition of local rights to natural resources, and establishment of platforms and collaborative networks to give mountain populations a \"voice\". Externally driven development Mountains have specific environments and economies. These constitute specific development contexts, a reality that is often not well understood or not taken into account by Defining mountain areas in Europe Many European countries define mountain areas according to constraints on agriculture. Altitude, length of growing seasons and slope are typical criteria. The minimum altitude increases from north to south. While it is 240 m in the UK, it rises to 600 m in mainland France and 700 m in Italy. policy- and decision-making institutions that are mainly located in urbanised and densely populated lowland areas. Hence, many mountain areas share a long history of political marginalisation. They have only limited access to policy and decision making beyond the local or the sub-national level and their development is externally driven. It is difficult to define an agenda for development that genuinely takes into account their specific needs. Partners with equal rights In order to enhance their position on the political agenda, mountain areas must become partners with equal rights. This can be achieved if they are given the power to advocate their interests, especially vis--vis political and economic centres. This requires long-term political commitment, at the national policy level, to concepts such as participation in policy making, federalism, Community-based property rights \"A key component (of mountain development) will entail the legal recognition of community-based property rights and the devolution of management authority to mountain communities, with government maintaining monitoring and regional coordination powers.\" From: Mountain Laws and Peoples, 1999 Key issues, principles and strategies 7 Recognition of traditional rights in Suriago del Sur, Philippines In traditional economies, access to ancestral land is the basis for hunting, collecting, and processing forest products. Some of these activities also have a spiritual value, as they are a form of communication with the spirits of the ancestors. In Suriago del Sur, an international NGO supported local partners in establishing a platform for negotiation with the central government. In 1997, the Government of the Philippines delivered a deed to the indigenous communities to guarantee these rights. decentralisation, local institution building, or subsidiarity. This is not a radical plea for political autonomy of mountain areas. Mountain communities depend on surrounding areas for the exchange of goods and services, and are well aware of this. Recognition, policies, and laws Development in mountain and lowland areas has to follow different paths because the conditions for resource management and production are different. Countries that differentiate between mountain and other areas at the national level, and apply this differentiation to the relevant sector policies, have made a significant step towards acknowledging the specificity of mountain areas and thus promoting their sustainable development. Checklist for national policy makers: Do mountain areas have a lobby in national policy and decision making? Is decentralisation an issue in your country? Has it progressed in the last 10 years? How are mountain areas defined in your country? Do any official maps demarcate mountain areas? Are traditional rights to natural resources considered in policies and laws? Do mountain regions have a voice in policy and decision making, for example through interest groups? Depending on the purpose of the differentiation between highland and lowland areas, it can be made according to altitude, watersheds, or political units. It is particularly important to acknowledge local rights of access to, and use of natural resources. As the example of Suriago del Sur shows (see box), recognition of such rights can be the expression of a policy aiming to acknowledge the specificity of development in mountain areas. Alliances for consensus building Mountain areas harbour very diverse societies, due to differences that reach far back in history. It is therefore often difficult for mountain communities to reach a consensus, although this is currently in the interest of both the individual communities and national policy makers: in today's world, mountain areas need to advocate their interests in a concerted manner, as \"one voice\". It is therefore important to promote formal and informal networks and platforms through which mountain communities can exchange information, establish the terms of collaboration, build consensus and express their specific development interests. Members of an ethnic minority community in Suriago del Sur, Philippines. (Helvetas) Small towns such as this one in Peru are often overlooked by development programmes. However, they can play an important role in mountain development. On the other hand, their prosperity also depends on development in the surrounding mountain areas. (P. Walther) 8 Sustainable Development in Mountain Areas Compensation for services rendered to surrounding areas Mountains possess unique natural resources such as fresh water, forests, minerals, and attractive landscapes for tourism. Often, these resources are developed and exploited with external intervention and investment, and profits are rarely re-invested in mountain areas. Hence, they continue to suffer from a lack of capital, widespread poverty, degradation of natural resources, and outmigration. Adequate compensation for the use of these resources should be granted to mountain areas as part of a comprehensive arrangement between highland and lowland systems. The development of the city of Los Angeles depends heavily on mountain water resources that have to be transported over very great distances. (P. Walther) Extraction of natural resources The ways in which mountain resources are extracted often have historical roots. Mountain areas have always been the \"hinterlands\" of urban centres. Their resources have been the wealth on which the development and industrialisation of a country was built; these resources have been taken for granted by \"heartland\" societies. Today, such extraction is an increasingly serious threat to the sustainability of develop- Century-old commitments In British Columbia, Canada, the provincial government leased forest lands to logging companies as early as 1900. Native communities' property rights were not on the political agenda at that time. Attempts to \"right such wrongs\" can lead to high costs and complex legal cases for governments. ment in mountain areas. In many parts of the world, property rights to natural resources have never been granted to local people. Often, land speculation has led to the sale of the most valuable properties to outside interests. Globalisation increases pressure Globalisation and current neo-liberalist trends may accelerate the extraction of mountain resources. International power engineering, water, and mining companies are building alliances with the better informed leaders of traditionally-organised mountain societies. At the end, only a few profit from the resulting investments, particularly if these do not lead to permanent, wellpaid, and safe local jobs. Mountain areas are doubly disadvantaged: mountain resources are rarely processed in these areas, which also have to buy the Checklist for national policy makers: Are financial flows between mountains and lowlands analysed? Do sectoral policies recognise, and prevent, the negative impacts of resource extraction in mountains? What are the trade-offs of globalisation and liberalisation in mountain areas? Are the rights of mountain communities to local resources ensured in national policies and laws? Can these rights be defended in court? Is compensation for the use of mountain resources on the political agenda in your country? Are there any examples of compensation mechanisms? Key issues, principles and strategies 9 processed goods back from the lowland areas, mostly at a higher cost than people in urban centres. Clarifying rights and obligations The first step, politically sensitive and most disputed, is to define the rights and obligations of mountain communities with regard to local natural resources. Rights to land, forests, fresh water and, in some cases, minerals have to be defined in keeping with a country's legal system, as traditional laws are unlikely to be defendable in court. Legalisation provides minimal protection against inequitable extraction, and prepares the ground for local investment as well as for negotiation of compensation for use of resources. Preparation of resource cadastres and development of a court system in which Timber royalties in northern Pakistan In Kalam, northern Pakistan, local communities receive timber royalties from commercial firms amounting to approximately US$ 50100 per year and household. Royalties are negotiated between the contract partners. Some of the money is re-invested in tourism. Economic instruments Compensation does not necessarily involve payment of subsidies to disadvantaged areas, a well-known tool in European mountain areas. Other economic instruments include: investment and social compensation funds, payment of royalties for the use of natural resources (e.g. water, forests), taxes. rights to resources can be defended is a more demanding and expensive task, requiring long-term commitment of national policy makers. mental impacts. Compensation should also be paid for loss of access to resources caused, for example, by the establishment of a nature reserve. Families in Kalam, Pakistan received significant income from royalties paid by logging companies. They invested part of the money in local tourism development. Recently, income from royalties decreased, due to the proclamation of forest bans. (P. Walther) Chumbivilcas, Peru. Construction of this community building was made possible with money from the social compensation fund. (P. Walther) Negotiating compensation The question whether mountain people have a right to be compensated for the goods and services that they contribute towards national growth and prosperity in downstream centres, requires political discussion at the national level. Such a debate can decisively influence efforts to address poverty effectively in mountain areas. Once rights and obligations are agreed upon, it is possible to discuss appropriate compensation mechanisms. Instruments to devise such mechanisms for a wide range of resources exist in many countries. In the case of large-scale resource development, such as commercial forestry or dam construction, local communities should receive compensation for negative environ- 10 Sustainable Development in Mountain Areas Diversification and the benefit of complementarities Many of the world's mountains are marginal lands, with little potential for large-scale agriculture or other mono-functional uses. Mountain communities and families have traditionally overcome such limitations by diversifying and using complementarities. Thus, many mountain economies are characterised by use of land in various altitudinal belts and climatic zones, complementary income from other sectors such as small industry and tourism, and seasonal migration. Policy makers should build on the strength of such diversified systems. Salinas de Maras, Peru. A unique cultural landscape that provides significant income to local families. (P. Walther) Traditional economies Mountain landscapes contain a mosaic of small areas with different climatic and topographic conditions. This normally imposes narrow limitations on large-scale forms of land use such as mono-functional commercial agriculture. For centuries, multi-functionality was therefore a key principle of mountain agriculture and economies. Complex land management systems with land in different altitudinal belts required large families, as work had to be done simultaneously in several areas. These \"Farming here is enough for the stomach, but not for buying clothes or for educating our children. To achieve this, you have to add other businesses like trade or tourism.\" Farmer from the Annapurna region, Nepal. Undermining of diversification For centuries, the people of Maras (Cuzco, Peru) earned additional income from over 6000 salt fields (salinas), which they had inherited from the Incas. This helped them secure their livelihoods. A recent national mining law confronted them with the existential threat that the right to use \"their\" salt fields might be sold to an international company. multi-functional systems provided stability in a hostile and marginal environment. The beauty of the resulting cultural landscapes has become an asset for tourism (see page 14). The limits of modernisation In mountain areas in the South, traditional multi-functional land management is still often practised. In most countries in the North, modernisation of traditional land-use systems was inevitable due to social change. Gradual integration of the workforce in business, industry and tourism prevented massive depopulation and land abandonment after the 1950s, when modernisation set in and agriculture no longer provided a sufficient basis for livelihoods. Simultaneously, the agricultural sector was modernised, leading to a concentration on fewer land-use zones in mountains. But modernisation did not make monofunctional approaches and economies of scale more suitable for mountain conditions than before. Multi-functionality continued to be the best development option for many mountain economies in the North. In the South, similar strategies oriented Key issues, principles and strategies 11 towards economies of scale and mono-functional land use were adopted as blueprints from the North, seldom leading to sustainable results in mountain areas. For example, investment in large-scale fruit tree or other cash crop plantations, as well as in mass tourism, increased dependence on unpredictable external markets and climatic conditions. Developing economic niches Experience shows that policies and strategies for the sustainable development of mountain areas benefit from careful and participatory assessment of the opportunities and limitations of multi-functional systems in mountain economies. Identification of economic niches is one element of such an assessment. The central role of agriculture as a local source of food, employment and income must be acknowledged, particularly in the South. If based on small-scale enterprises, industry and services such as tourism spread risks and strengthen local economies. A diversified economy based on natural resources is an important means of retaining people in mountain areas and maintaining decentralised settlement patterns. This, in turn, helps conserve unique cultural landscapes, biodiversity and ecosystems. Mountain economies can be successfully integrated into world markets, as demonstrated by the case study on commercial cooperation programmes (pages 2425). Better Checklist for national policy makers: Have the characteristics of the mountain economy in your country been analysed and do decision makers know about them? Are sectoral policies biased in favour of promoting mono-functional resource use? If so: what has been done to prevent the risks this entails for mountain areas? Do national policies and programmes exist that target mountain economies, increase the range of economic options and include strategies of diversification? Have the possibilities of achieving complementarity between mountain and lowland areas been identified? advice, improved access to markets, quality labelling, and the use of new instruments such as information technology and export promotion programmes, increase the capacity of mountain people to strengthen their economies and define their own agenda for sustainable development. Complementarity with lowland areas Investing in decentralised infrastructure such as rural roads, to cover basic needs and develop land and resources, will remain an important strategy for mountain development. Improved access also increases the potential for exploiting complementarity with downstream areas and population centres. Local governments or communities can maintain rural roads if they have adequate expertise and funds. Decentralisation programmes (see pages 2223) can help develop these resources. Provided basic services are available, ecotourism ideally complements mountain economies, not least because it depends on an attractive environment enhanced by diversified land use and a rich local cultural heritage.

Messerli) A diversified economy strengthens mountain livelihoods. Processing raw materials from artisanal mining, Bolivia. (T. Hentschel) 12 Sustainable Development in Mountain Areas Innovation through collaboration. Foresters seek common answers in a government tree nursery in Pakistan. (P. Walther) Taking full advantage of the local potential for innovation Local potential for innovation is a key factor in mountain development, requiring support for human resource development and capacity building. Promotion strategies must involve local leaders and increase investment in decentralised education systems that meet the needs of mountain areas without neglecting linkage with national and global networks that promote innovation. An appropriate policy framework can create an enabling environment and support the combined efforts of local communities, governments, the private sector, and NGOs for tapping local innovation potentials. Innovation versus brain drain One common explanation for underdevelopment and widespread poverty in mountain Protecting innovations in the Andes of Bolivia The Agroecology Programme of the University of Cochabamba (AGRUCO) in Bolivia developed a simple methodology to document local technologies and innovations in the form of handbills. To date, around 1000 handbills have been produced. Community authorities watch over them as part of their \"cultural heritage\". Innovations that have been documented in the collection of \"Andean technologies\" cannot be patented by foreign multinational firms. areas is that the local potential for innovation is inadequately tapped and hardly integrated into development policies and efforts to exploit production and market opportunities. In mountains, as in other marginal areas, the local potential for innovation is weakened by brain drain. If employment and income alternatives are lacking, younger and more innovative people are the first to leave. Regionally anchored education Mountain people face specific challenges not only in securing their livelihoods but also in providing a future for their children. The provision of basic education is a vital first step towards offering a perspective to the younger generation. It is also the basis for acquiring access to higher-level education in technology, engineering, business, administration, and other skills and training that promote innovation, especially in small industry and business, but also in agriculture. Centro Bartolom de las Casas, Peru Founded in 1985 as a non-profit organisation by the Church, the Centro Bartolom de las Casas (CBC) in Cuzco has developed into a regional centre that stimulates democratisation and development in the often very remote areas of the Peruvian Andes. Besides running a study centre and a unit for applied research, the \"Casa de Campesino\" regularly organises courses for local leaders from the villages, and information about market prices is disseminated by radio. The Centro has its own web site: http://www.cbc.org.pe Key issues, principles and strategies 13 Innovation knows many small ways Farmers in the eastern highlands of Ethiopia integrate elements of traditional and external soil and water conservation techniques. They combine terraces with trashlines of sorghum straw and traditional drainage. This unspectacular, but meaningful innovation optimises conservation, scarce land resources, and labour input. Local agricultural colleges, technical schools, and other higher education institutions that take into account the specific needs of mountain areas while maintaining links to new developments in the wider world, can become focal points of innovation and development. Planning of education and development of curricula should involve both local and outside institutions and individuals. Centralised planning at the national level often means inadequate coverage of remote mountain areas and curricula that are less meaningful for mountain people. In countries in the South but not only there technical and business colleges and other higher education facilities initiated and directed by NGOs or the private sector often play a very important role, particularly when they can create an environment for discussing an area's specific problems and for seeking innovative solutions. Such facilities can Checklist for national policy makers: Is brain drain in mountain areas recognised as a problem? What does the government do to prevent it? What are the investments per capita for education in mountain areas, compared to downstream areas? Are the curricula adapted to the realities of mountain development? Do local technical colleges or NGO-led centres with the potential to become focal points for innovation in mountain areas exist? Is there a language barrier in education, and if so, is it being addressed? Does the government provide incentives to promote innovation in mountain areas? Are there examples of innovations from mountain areas that are now legally protected, such as specific brands or products? become the main intellectual centres of an area, as teachers often speak local languages and are familiar with the local people and culture. The impact of such centres can be enhanced if they have the capacity to manage donor-funded development projects. Creating an enabling environment Innovation gains momentum if opportunities to exchange local and external knowledge exist. Such interaction initiates learning processes that can be enhanced by the exchange of success stories that serve as role models, and by the organisation of platforms that facilitate the exchange of experience between private enterprises, policy makers, local authorities, and research and training institutions. Credits for new ventures, know-how about how to obtain them, access to ways of protecting intellectual property and collaborating with international specialists, and basic knowledge of business management are additional important ingredients for promoting innovation and translating it into successful local ventures. Other enabling factors such as a reasonable range of employment opportunities, access to capital, and good quality basic services (health, education, supply of consumer goods) are commonly needed to retain trained people. Many of these factors are provided by private institutions. Supporting the publication and dissemination of national professional journals in local languages can also support innovation and facilitate the exchange of local and external knowledge. Radio programmes can serve the same function. Such forms of exchange can enhance self-reliance and self-esteem, and strengthen the local potential for innovation.

(W. Popp) Cultural change without loss of identity A great diversity of cultures can be found in mountain areas. The richness and diversity of this global heritage is at risk from rapid social and cultural change. Reasons for this change include population pressure, poverty, migration, and the global dominance of urban values, transmitted to the most remote mountain areas by the mass media, standardised formal education, and tourism. Measures to counter this cultural erosion are needed, not least because cultural identity and self-esteem are essential ingredients for development. Lively mountain cultures A great variety of cultures can be found in mountain areas, for various reasons. Many mountain areas harbour ethnic minorities, and until recently, mountain people were often less exposed to the outside world than other societies, mainly due to difficult access. Yet mountain cultures have never been static. Trade across mountain passes and with downstream areas, and seasonal migration have always connected mountain people to the wider world. Such interaction complemented local knowledge and values with new ideas and skills. However, pressures of change used to be less pervasive. \"Abnormal\" situations that led to rapid economic, social and cultural change, and sometimes disruption, occurred during wars, epidemics, and natural disasters. Landscape and knowledge as heritage Landscapes shaped by terraces and irrigation systems are among the great achievements of mountain cultures. Such land-use systems, including the associated institutions, developed as mountain people interacted closely with their environments, and they document long learning processes. Mountain societies carry precious knowledge, for example about stabilising sloping land, extending growing seasons at high altitudes, or using myriad plants for agriculture and medicine. This knowledge, often only oral, is a resource for sustainable development. The risks of breaking with the past Through modernisation and mass media, even remote mountain valleys and settlements have become exposed to mainstream western culture, which is largely urban. Tourists travelling in mountains increase this exposure, which can lead to a severe risk of Checklist for national policy makers: Are traditional mountain cultures and ethnic minorities acknowledged in your country? Do traditional cultural landscapes and types of resource use exist that are symbols of a mountain culture? What does your country do to preserve them for future generations? Do sectoral policies adequately respect mountain cultures? Do national radio or TV programmes address mountain development and mountain cultures? Are indigenous languages officially accepted in schools, administration, and courts? Key issues, principles and strategies 15 Vietnam: increasing sensitiveness to ethnic minorities In Vietnam, a Committee for Ethnic Minorities and Mountain Areas was created in 1993. It supports the implementation of a programme designed for 1715 poor communes, many of them in mountain areas. The programme, implemented jointly with the FAO since 1998 and until 2005, aims to create jobs and incomes, improve infrastructure, and allocate administrative tasks at the local level. loss of orientation and of cultural identity, cultural homogenisation, and the collapse of traditional cultures. The impact of such developments can be dramatic, leading to irreversible loss of indigenous knowledge. Tension and conflict can increase within communities and households when some people, eager to embrace modernity, turn their back on their own cultures and adopt new modes, norms, and values. All this can lead to undermining and disrupting a specific culture within a few decades. A culture disappears when the critical mass of young people needed to maintain traditional cultural practices no longer exists. Elements of mountain cultures may then live on among migrants in urban areas. Adequate policy responses? To promote nation building, integration and modern development, governments often actively advocate cultural homogenisation. Many also lack understanding and respect for the particularities of mountain cultures. As a result, mountain people, especially ethnic minorities, often face economic, social, and political disadvantages or outright discrimination. Their language may be forbidden, or banned from public schools, government administration, and courts. These are serious obstacles for promoting sustainable development in mountain areas. They also undermine efforts to maintain political stability. An appropriate policy response could be to officially recognise the value of cultural diversity and to support it actively. Mountain people must be given realistic opportunities for self-determination, and for defining their own pace of cultural change and develop- ment, within the national context. Increased efforts to support cultural diversity should be reflected in sectoral policies such as agriculture and education. Documentation, sensitisation, and networking by using the media, the Internet, exhibitions, cultural associations and museums, are important to raise awareness of the value of traditions, and to foster and integrate new trends and developments that will keep mountain cultures alive. Mountain cultures must not be \"protected\" from modernisation. What is important is to strengthen mountain societies so that they can resist forced acculturation that disrupts their cultures, livelihoods, and personal lives.

The project started in 2002 and the students are expected to share this knowledge, one day, with fellow students in their own monasteries or in Tibet. The project will contribute to keeping alive Tibetan spiritual culture and opening it for dialogue and cultural exchange. info@tibet-institut.ch Rice terraces in Bali. Landscapes shaped by irrigated terraces are among the great achievements of mountain cultures and are a valuable asset for tourism. (H.P. Liniger) 16 Sustainable Development in Mountain Areas Tropical mountain forests are biodiversity hotspots. (T. Kohler) Conservation of mountain ecosystems and early warning function Owing to their climatic and topographic diversity, mountain areas are hotspots of biodiversity. Yet the natural heritage of their ecosystems is vulnerable and can be easily destroyed, particularly on steep slopes and at high altitudes. Due to their sensitivity, mountain ecosystems tend to react to environmental degradation and global environmental trends earlier and more clearly than lowland ecosystems. They are early warning systems and hence of increasing importance in an era of global change. Mountains as hotspots of biodiversity Mountain ecosystems have a particularly high degree of diversity, with significant differences over small distances. This is due to several factors such as altitudinal gradients of temperature and rainfall, and high levels of endemism, i.e. of plants and animals that are found nowhere else. In mountains in the South, for example, tropical mountain forests typically host more species in a smaller area than lowland rainforests. About half of the global Endemic Bird Areas are in mountain regions, particularly in tropical forests. And almost all forest plants in the mountains of Hawaii and New Caledonia are endemic. The values of mountain biodiversity have been known for centuries to indigenous people. External interest groups, such as phar- Mountain biodiversity, a world heritage 45% of all biosphere reserves in UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere (MAB) programme are in mountain areas. Incorporate principles Apart from creating nature reserves and conservation areas, it is important to ensure that the principles of conservation are adequately reflected in sectoral policies (agriculture, forestry), and in natural resource management programmes. maceutical companies, research institutions and government agencies are becoming increasingly aware of its commercial importance. Vulnerability and sensitivity Mountain ecosystems are extremely vulnerable to change, particularly in areas with short vegetation periods and steep slopes. The tundra vegetation above the treeline is a case in point. Its extreme environment is characterised by high temperature variation, frequent frost, poor soils, and unstable slopes. Today, this vegetation zone is disturbed in many mountain areas by tourism or increased pressure of grazing. Once destroyed, such vegetation can hardly be restored, even with the most labour-intensive methods. Other mountain ecosystems, such as forests, are threatened by commercial agriculture and the advance of subsistence farming in countries of the South, and by underuse and air pollution in the North. These developments threaten not only biodiversity, but also the crucial roles of mountain forests with regard to provision of safe water and protection against natural hazards. Conservation and development In the past, conservation programmes were initiated solely in response to the need for Key issues, principles and strategies 17 preserving mountain ecosystems. Today, conservation often integrates local people's need for development, for example through the creation of buffer zones around national parks. In industrialised countries, conservation programmes have been relatively effectively based on legally binding inventories of endangered species and ecosystems that are identified for protection. Land owners have generally been adequately compensated. In developing countries, promising results have been achieved by involving local communities in planning and implementing conservation projects, and making it possible for them to benefit from the employment and income these projects generate. An important lesson from both industrialised and developing countries is that biodiversity is well maintained in areas where traditional forms of land use continue. Another economic activity that is largely compatible with biodiversity conservation is ecotourism. Increasing investment in this form of tourism is positive for biodiversity conservation in mountains. Early warning: the global context Owing to their fragility and diversity, mountain ecosystems register global environmental changes earlier and more clearly than lowland systems. Mountains are the only environments that occur in all climatic zones of the Monitoring global change in mountains The Mountain Research Initiative (MRI) and the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves have joined forces to study the impacts of global and environmental change in mountain ecosystems. earth tropical, subtropical, temperate, and arctic. Mountain areas are thus of crucial importance for global environmental monitoring. They are the only global-scale terrestrial early warning system for natural and human-induced forms of change such as climate change. This role needs to be preserved. Environmental monitoring programmes in mountains can be used to analyse trends, raise global awareness, and observe the effectiveness of remedial policies and action. Checklist for national policy makers: Are biodiversity hotspots and the most vulnerable mountain ecosystems protected by legally binding inventories? Is the specific need to protect mountain ecosystems reflected in sectoral policies and laws (forestry, planning, and construction)? Do positive examples exist which illustrate that development can be achieved without negative impacts on biodiversity and vulnerable ecosystems? Which mountain landscapes and ecosystems in your country are particularly endangered by global environmental change (for example global warming)? What coping strategies does your government have? Left: Soil erosion on sloping land in Honduras. (Ch. Kchli) Right: Conservation and management plans for protected areas and buffer zones were prepared after completion of a national inventory of all remaining moorlands in Switzerland. (P. Walther) Rocky Mountains, Canada. Extreme climatic and topographical conditions, short vegetation periods and poor soils increase the vulnerability of mountain ecosystems to environmental change, including global warming. (P. Walther) 18 Sustainable Development in Mountain Areas Institutionalising sustainable development of mountain areas Despite its global importance, sustainable development in mountain areas is not yet well established at global, regional or national levels. The International Year of Mountains, IYM2002, offers a unique opportunity to anchor this issue more firmly, especially at the national level. The tasks include advocacy, lobbying and institutionalisation, as well as exchange of professional and technical expertise. In Italy, mountain development is included as a goal at the level of the constitution. (P. Walther) Identifying opportunities Establishing sustainable development of mountain areas on the political agenda is a process that will take time. But the opportunity presented by the International Year of Mountains (IYM) 2002 and the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg should be seized to institutionalise mountain development more firmly and formally at the global, regional, national and sub-national levels. \"Our secretariat checks all laws and regulations issued by the national government to make sure they take into account the interests of mountain communities.\" Member of the Federation of Mountain Cantons (Provinces), Switzerland Mountain development should, in fact, have a broad global constituency: in 53 countries around the globe, mountains cover over 50% of the national area, and in 46 others between 25% and 50%. In many other countries, mountains play important roles for example as water towers despite the fact that they occupy smaller portions of the countries' total area. Mountain development is therefore a concern for the international community. The national level as the point of entry The national level is the most important level for the institutionalisation of mountain development because the authority to formulate policies, laws and regulations rests with individual states. The first step could be to Key issues, principles and strategies 19 create a national task force such as the National Committees formed to prepare the IYM. The mandate of such groups could be to raise parliamentarians', decision makers' and the general public's awareness of the importance of sustainable mountain development, revise sectoral policies to improve their effectiveness for tackling mountain issues, and maintain linkages with international initiatives and partnerships. Creating supportive networks The creation of formal and informal networks such as private associations or NGOs for the exchange of information and for collaboration is vital to bring mountain issues into political agendas and to keep them there through advocacy, lobbying, and awarenessraising. Both national policy makers and the private sector can benefit from the presence of such counterparts. They can play an important role in formulating or reviewing appropriate policy frameworks, policy initiatives, and sectoral policies for mountain area development. They can facilitate consensus building in broad political debates at the national and sub-national levels, involving people who have in-depth knowledge about mountain reality and who are directly affected by these realities. Checklist for national policy makers: What steps have been taken in your country to institutionalise the issue of sustainable development in mountain areas? What is the focal point in your government administration for issues related to sustainable development in mountain areas? Has this focal point been attributed sufficient personnel capacity and expertise? Is this focal point integrated in national policy and decision making, and linked to international initiatives? Do any informal networks exist that are recognised by your government as counterparts in the formulation of policies for mountain development? Which activities has your government planned as a follow-up of the International Year of Mountains? Examples of pressure and interest groups Associations of mountain municipalities, groups of parliamentarians from mountain constituencies, mountain farmers' associations, mountain tourism organisations, forestry-related organisations, mountain research associations. IYM 2002 a stepping stone The International Year of Mountains (IYM) 2002 offers a unique opportunity to make a first step in the process of institutionalising mountain development at the national level. At the international level, this process could be supported, for example, by an international coalition for mountain development, or a mountain partnership network involving governments, NGOs, the private sector, and research institutions. Alliance building within the UN system is equally needed. The UN Commission on Sustainable Development and the FAO could play a leading role in such alliances. Their work could be supported by a network of governmental and non-governmental organisations that function as pressure groups. Participation and public vote, Bolivia. Decentralisation, democratisation and development of local capacity are longterm processes. (AGRUCO) 20 Sustainable Development in Mountain Areas Forests cover about 43% of the land area of Costa Rica; 60% are privately owned. The compensation fund for environmental services from mountain forests is an institution that meets economic and ecological demands. The latest firm to sign a contract was \"Cerveceria Costa Rica\", a brewery and water bottling company that depends on clean water for production. (Ch. Kchli) National and regional experience Central America: Costa Rica Compensation for environmental services from mountain forests Environmental services provided by mountain forest ecosystems are crucial to people and economies. However, there are still few initiatives that aim to compensate forest owners for these services. A successful model has been implemented nation-wide in Costa Rica, where the 1996 Forestry Law incorporated an innovative decision to compensate forest owners for the environmental services their forests provide to society. Since 1996, proposals have been put forward for financing of the system, through including the cost of watershed management in the cost of hydroelectricity and water supplies. The first contracts with private firms have now been signed. Costa Rica's forests are characterised by rich biodiversity. Biological corridors have been identified, and the Global Environment Facility has provided funds for sustainable management of an area covering 100,000 ha. (Ch. Kchli) The main assumption underlying payment for environmental services was that forests would be better maintained and protected if forest owners were compensated for the services their forests provide. As Costa Rica cannot afford to establish and effectively manage more national parks and protected areas, the mechanism of payment for environmental services was thought to be a suitable alternative. Costa Rica's 1996 Forestry Law acknowledged a number of environmental services, ranging from the uptake of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere to the protection of water sources, biodiversity, ecosystems, and natural scenic beauty for tourism and scientific uses. Levels of payment for environmental services and periods of commitment vary according to the type of land use. How the compensation system works The compensation system is managed by the National Fund for Forestry Finance of Costa Rica (FONAFIFO), which is responsible National and regional experience 21 for collecting resources and paying the beneficiaries for environmental services. Funds come mainly from two sources: a selective tax on consumption of fossil fuels, and national and international payments for environmental services of local or global value. The sums fixed for the payment for watershed services in Costa Rica are shown in the table to the right. They result from negotiations between FONAFIFO and the companies. The reason for a higher payment, for example, by Compaa Hidroelctrica Platanar for lands without clear land tenure is, that FONAFIFO cannot use public funds to pay for environmental services where there is no clear land tenure. The world's first ecomarket Encouraged by this positive experience, FONAFIFO and the Government of Costa Rica have recently negotiated the establishment of the world's first ecomarket, with the support of the World Bank and the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The World Bank has provided a US$ 32.6 million loan, and GEF has provided a grant of US$ 8 million, based on US$ 10 per hectare per year for the contribution of the system to the conservation of the world's biodiversity. The aim is to promote the development of markets for environmental services from private forests. Projections into the future From 1997 to 2001, US$ 57 million was invested in payments for environmental services, resulting in the preservation of 230,000 ha of private natural forests, the sustainable Signing the first contracts FONAFIFO has been able to negotiate payment for watershed services with three hydroelectric corporations, a private brewery and bottling company, and one multilateral fund. The first agreement was signed with Compaa Energa Global, a private company that operates two hydroelectric projects in the Central Volcanic Range of Costa Rica. These funds are used by FONAFIFO, in close collaboration with the Ministry of Environment and Energy and the Foundation for the Development of the Central Volcanic Range; this NGO provides technical assistance to forest owners.

For example, in 2000 the demand was for approximately 175,000 ha, but only 28,897 ha were funded. This indicates that forest owners have accepted the compensation system and that they might agree with the amounts paid for the environmental services provided by their forests.

(AGRUCO) Below: Watershed protection goes beyond the borders of family plots and promotes cooperation and exchange of experience. (AGRUCO) South America: Bolivia Decentralisation and strengthening local institutions: two complementary strategies Decentralisation and local institution building are recognised as keys to sustainable development in mountain areas. In South America, Bolivia has taken a lead. In 1994 and 1995, three new laws on People's Participation, Decentralisation, and Municipalities radically changed the architecture of the Bolivian state. Although decentralisation and strengthening of local civil society are long-term processes, valuable lessons have already been learned. Historical background Already at the end of the 16th century, a descendant of the Inca dynasty, Guaman Poma de Ayala, gave an initial response to the social and political disorder caused by the first years of Spanish colonialism. In his \"New Chronicle on Good Governance\" he claimed that the Spanish rulers should respect indigenous forms of local governance as a basis for establishing an alliance for development with the colonial administration. Until 1994, the country remained to be, however, characterised by heavy centralisation. There were no municipal governments in rural areas, and only the larger cities received funds from the central government. Consequently, the rural areas where half of all Bolivians still lived remained generally unaffected by public investments in development. A multi-dimensional process The laws on People's Participation, Decentralisation, and Municipalities made possible a far-reaching decentralisation, based on democratically elected municipalities. However, it also became clear that decentralisation is a complex process with many additional requirements. The first key element is the systematic transfer of economic resources to local governments. In Bolivia, 20% of the public revenues are transferred automatically to the local level; amounts are calculated on the basis of population figures. Recently the distribution pattern was modified with respect to six different categories of social and economic marginalisation. Second, significant investments are aimed at strengthening the local system of planning and management. Municipal development plans are recognised as a basis for negotiation by the national government. Third, the need for more effective social control over municipal governments has been recognised. Comits de Vigilancia (Vigi- National and regional experience 23 Changing the local development agenda Irupana is a municipality of some 12,000 inhabitants located on the slopes of the eastern Andes. Livelihood systems are based on highly diversified agriculture extending over three different agroecological zones, ranging from 10002500 m. Before the reforms, the municipality had an annual budget of about 3000 Bolivianos; by 1998 this had risen to 2,085,450. In 1997 civil society and the municipality jointly decided to change the way financial resources were allocated. Instead of supporting activities mainly benefiting the town areas, preference was given to rural development projects. In particular, farmers focused on meeting the norms for organic coffee that can be sold to a locally based company supplying fair trade organisations in Western countries. lance Committees) were established. They link municipal government with the many traditional indigenous organisations in order to institutionalise social control (see box below). In order to become recognised as legitimate partners of the state, the Comits de Vigilancia were allowed to constitute themselves as territorial grassroots organisations. An initial assessment of impacts It is too early to make a firm evaluation of impacts, but some interesting lessons can be learned which might be relevant to other countries. In the early years, development plans in the 314 municipalities still largely reflected conventional political and business activities. Local elites took advantage of their knowledge about management and public administration and tended to dominate the process. The second municipal elections (2000) brought a change. It appears that the power of the local elites was reduced, and that more mayors were chosen from indigenous communities. Simultaneously, the number of projects targeted at rural development (for example rural roads, improvements in market infrastructure) increased. Future perspectives Today, some people claim there has been serious deterioration of the reforms. There is even a tendency to return to the old centralised system. Lack of capacity in municipal administrations, politisation, and lack of transparency are concerns. While these problems have to be monitored carefully, they are increasingly understood as part of an important social learning process that goes beyond formal implementation of a new model of public administration and may last for decades. One major feature of this learning process is that local populations have actively responded to new political opportunities resulting from the redefinition of the role of civil society, and have made proposals for introducing elements of direct democracy. One of the particular strengths of the Bolivian experience is that the process was not imposed according to a Western model of public administration. There is a consensus among stakeholders that decentralisation and local institution building, if combined with institutionalised social control, will constitute important steps towards sustainable development of mountain areas. Freddy Delgado, Stephan Rist Until recently, access to drinking water was a privilege restricted to urban areas. Since drinking water facilities became a part of municipal development plans, they have spread throughout indigenous communities. (AGRUCO) Members of the Comit de Vigilancia of the municipality of Cliza, checking budget and development plans prepared by the local government. (AGRUCO) Comits de Vigilancia The main objective of the Committees is to assure permanent and critical supervision of the activities of the municipal governments. They also help to channel the aspirations of the local population and the private sector. They have no autonomous means of sanction, but they can report irregularities to different authorities, leading to legal investigations. The members of the Vigilance Committee are appointed by civil society organisations according to their own system of legitimacy. Concerted deliberations often lead to the appointment of traditional leaders in local civil society. Through the law on Public Participation, the Vigilance Committees, constituted as grassroots organisations, became official development partners of the government. This was an important historic step for the more than 19,000 rural communities, as it was the first time that native forms of organisation were formally recognised since the Andean people were colonised. 24 Sustainable Development in Mountain Areas Leaching the soil with water from the Lauca River. (E. Schaltegger) South America: Bolivia and Peru Commercial cooperation programmes to make mountain economies fit for export markets Andean countries have attempted numerous development policies and strategies to achieve economic development. Most recently there has been a radical opening to world markets. But do mountain economies have a chance to be internationally competitive? International experts believe so. Since 1999, the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) of the Swiss Federal Department of Economic Affairs has supported a joint commercial cooperation programme in Bolivia, concentrating particularly on mountain areas, with the aim of strengthening the private sector. Tourism, agricultural products, and mining have been identified as profitable sectors. A second programme is planned for Peru. Developing a tourism destination One early activity was the development of a strategy for sustainable tourism in mountain areas with spectacular attractions: the region including Sucre, the colonial capital of Bolivia; the silver-mining city of Potos, one of the richest cities of the world in the 17th cen- Two niche products Botanically speaking, Qunoa and Kaniwa are meldweeds or goosefoots, not cereals. They grow between 3000 and 4000 metres above sea level and are resistant to drought and frost, but yield a grain that is very rich in high-quality proteins, minerals, and lipids, and also high in unsaturated fatty acids. tury; and the salt lake of Uyuni, \"where you can touch the sky\". To overcome age-old differences between these regions, their people, and the authorities, it was decided to establish a new tourism destination management organisation, for joint development of the many public and private services required for tourism to flourish. One challenge is to integrate different interest groups for example tourist, environmental, municipal into one overarching vision and strategy to resolve conflicting attitudes and to benefit the region. Traditional agricultural products Bolivia's highlands are the source of numerous traditional crops that can be turned into products with greater added value. Qunoa and Kaniwa are good examples. The local Aymara, Quetchua, and Chipaya people have been growing these crops since pre-Incan times, and the new commercial cooperation programme is now attempting to open some exclusive export opportunities for the producers of Qunoa and Kaniwa. The Chipayas, an ethnic group whose culture is threatened with disappearance, are specialists in growing Kaniwa. In an environment with a high incidence of night frost and soil salinity, the Chipayas leach the soil each year with water from the Lauca River, and then sow Kaniwa. The harvest of about one ton of grain per hectare gives them a modest income, but only if they can sell the grain. The issue at stake is whether it is possible to export roasted Kaniwa flour, a tasty and rich National and regional experience 25 \"We do not want free rides. Get us into export markets, and we will do the rest.\" Bolivian highland farmer supplement used in the food processing industry and the niche market trade in industrialised countries.

Small mining operations account for 16% of the export market and are a very important source of Right: Attractive products such as breakfast cereals, instant soups, and baking flour or pasta supplements are under development or already on the local markets. About 10%, or less than 3000 tons, of the Bolivian production of Quinoa is exported each year as grain, most of it certified as organically grown. (E. Schaltegger) employment in poor rural mountain areas. About 500,000 persons are directly or indirectly involved in Bolivian small-scale mining, a significant proportion of the national population of 8 million. The commercial cooperation programme promotes the local production of jewellery from gold mined by mining cooperatives. Such jewellery is marketed internationally under a fair trade label. There will be a significant return to the miners, guaranteeing higher incomes. In return, there is no child labour in these cooperatives, and improved living and environmental conditions can be attained. Conclusions In all three sectors mentioned, there is little doubt about the potential for substantial development of these mountain economies. Programme strategies The main strategies are: (a) to include more private sector representatives in decision-making about trade-related issues; (b) to reduce the burden of red tape for exporters; and (c) to search for, and to improve niche products for which there is a growing demand in sophisticated target markets. Therefore, this export promotion programme will also be extended to Peru. Given the population concentration in mountain areas, there is a need to formulate an overall national policy that includes, first, opening mountains and their tourist attractions to a wider public; second, attracting private investment in the artisanal mining sector; and third, motivating local people to participate more fully in both development activities and their benefits. International cooperation can do much to help local products meet international standards and to open foreign markets to such products.

The process of considering these problems jointly began in 1952, with the establishment of the Commission for the Protection of the Alps (CIPRA). In 1991, the environment ministers of the eight Alpine states and the European Commission signed an international treaty, the Alpine Convention, in Salzburg. CIPRA had paved the way for this Convention by raising awareness with studies and lobbying. Today, the Alpine Convention is increasingly recognised as an important step towards political recognition of these mountain areas. Saas Fee, a renowned tourist resort in the Swiss Alps, acknowledges the positive role which the Alpine Convention plays. According to Claude Bumann, president of the community, \"The Alpine Convention offers fantastic possibilities, beyond political boundaries, for collaboration and exchange of experiences about projects with which it is possible to create new jobs. Tourism is one example\". (T. Kohler) In light of the rapid deterioration of the Alpine environment, CIPRA decided in 1987 to lay the groundwork for an international treaty for protection of the Alps. The strategy was to raise public awareness and build an alliance involving local and regional governments. This bottom-up strategy had an impact. In 1989, the governments of the Alpine countries and the European Commission, under the leadership of the German Environment Minister, began to draft a treaty. They signed the Alpine Convention in 1991. This constituted a significant and concrete contribution by the eight Alpine states to the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development. Alpine states to look at very different issues and problems (see box), using a territorial rather than a sectoral approach for the benefit of an entire mountain range. While this made the process unique, it was by no means simple. Once the Convention was signed in 1991, it was not endorsed by the first group of signatories until 4 years later, and did not become binding on all of them for another 5 years. Of the 12 implementation protocols that were to be elaborated and signed, only 8 have been drafted. They were to be ratified by the signatories in 2002, 11 years after the original Convention was signed. Negotiations at the content level Despite several years of preparatory discussions, the treaty is a framework convention containing no specified means of application, although its Article 2 contains objectives that are to become binding on each signatory through more detailed protocols. The rest of the Convention is dedicated to specifying means of collaboration. One new and very positive aspect was the strong commitment of the governments of all CIPRA The International Commission for the Protection of the Alps (CIPRA) was founded in 1952 in Rottach-Egern (Germany). CIPRA is now an NGO that includes over 100 organisations and institutions interested in finding integrated solutions to problems of nature and landscape protection and management, environmental protection, and regional planning in the Alps. CIPRA has seven national offices and a regional office in Italy (South Tyrol). National and regional experience 27 Topics in the Alpine Convention The following topics are addressed in the Alpine Convention, through a territorial and integrated approach: population and culture; spatial development; air quality management; soil protection; water management; protection of nature and conservation of landscapes; mountain agriculture; mountain forests; tourism; transport; energy and waste management. From conservation to a framework for sustainable development From the beginning, the overall objective of the Convention was to create favourable conditions for better protection of nature and cultural landscapes, and to define, in parallel, a new framework for sustainable development in the Alps, based on criteria of environmental and social feasibility. There was a consensus that standards and norms for environmental protection and development had to be higher than those for the surrounding lowland areas. Yet despite clear arguments by its promoters, the Convention was not universally accepted. Many argued that it would be purely a \"protection framework\", preventing development in the Alps. One reason for this criticism was that the promoters had not given adequate attention to providing the necessary information and involving stakeholders and the public. It is gratifying to see that the participating countries had the capacity to respond with constructive arguments and to learn rapidly. The decision in 1992 to put more emphasis on socio-economic aspects and public involvement had a very positive impact on the whole process. sis and define objectives for the future of their mountain areas. Today, many of the 6000 Alpine communities perceive the Alpine Convention as an opportunity and, even more important, as an expression of the strong commitment of their national governments to the often marginal mountain areas. They know that this kind of solidarity will be increasingly important in the future. This positive assessment has replaced earlier criticisms that portrayed the Alpine Convention merely as a directive from national governments. Andreas Goetz The tremendous increase in trans-Alpine traffic has become a severe threat to the fragile mountain ecosystem that can best be dealt with in a framework of common policy. The signatories of the Alpine Convention have pledged to pursue a sustainable transport policy. One possible element of such a policy is the transport of goods across the Alps by rail. (A. Boillat, SBB) The logo of the Alpine Convention creates a sense of unity. (Courtesy CIPRA) Positive impacts to date The most significant impact of the Convention has been a new consensus among politicians and decision-makers that the Alps face particular development problems which must be considered jointly. Today numerous information exchange and collaborative networks, all referring to the Convention, are well established (see also pages 2829). It is encouraging that governments could come together in the heart of a densely populated continent to undertake problem analy- The Alpine Convention: A model for the Carpathian mountains? The Carpathian mountains, a trans-boundary mountain range with unique flora and fauna, cover an area of more than 200,000 km2 and extend into six Central and Eastern European countries. The Carpathian mountain ecosystem is under increasing pressure. The process of transition and structural changes now underway are having a heavy impact on relations among the people living in the Carpathians. A common policy framework for all Carpathian countries could help create a sustainable future in this unique region. The content of such a Convention would have to be adjusted to the regional conditions. 28 Sustainable Development in Mountain Areas The countries of the world and their mountain areas Map sources Terrain data: Resampled from the GTOP030 Digital Terrain Model (DTM) produced by the US Geological Survey (USGS) using a model by Kapos et al.

The countries of the world and their mountain areas 29 What is a mountain country? The map shows the countries of the world classified according to the percentage of their mountain area. Countries with a high percentage of mountain areas are found on all continents, and range from large countries such as China and Iran to small ones such as Lesotho, New Zealand, or Slovenia. Other countries such as the United States and Russia, or India, Canada and Algeria, with extensive mountain areas have a lower percentage due to their large plains and lowlands. The underlying hill shading shows that even countries with low percentages of mountain areas, such as Australia, Brazil, or Thailand, do have mountains which play an important role, for example, for the supply of fresh water. The map therefore indicates that sustainable mountain development is an issue of global importance that needs to be addressed in all regions of the world. The map was produced according to the pragmatic global approach by Kapos et al. (2000), that uses elevation, slope and local elevation range to define the \"mountain areas of the world\".

Today, other municipalities around the Pfynwald forest (see centre of the picture) are also members. They jointly implement the \"Landscape Experience Pfynwald\". After decades of conflicts between environmentalists, planners of roads, flood protection projects, and foresters, this project now defines the development goals for this unique forest ecosystem. (Alpenbro) Europe: Alpine communities \"Alliance in the Alps\": filling a policy framework with the spirit of innovation After the signing of the Alpine Convention in 1991, the process of cooperation on concrete problems got underway relatively slowly. The situation changed in 1996 with the foundation of \"Alliance in the Alps\", an organisation in which 27 Alpine communities started to collaborate actively to implement the principles of the Alpine Convention. This was an important breakthrough. Today, over 150 Alpine communities participate in this international network, which has become a breeding ground for innovation and exchange of experience. Constitution of the network \"Alliance in the Alps\" is an international non-profit organisation (association) with a board of actively engaged community presidents. In each of the eight Alpine countries, the association is represented by a country office, usually organised as a non-profit association. In Switzerland, where about 80 communities participate, the government finances a small network secretariat. One of the characteristics of the network is the great variety and heterogeneity of the participating municipalities, each of which faces different development issues. Though it is sometimes difficult to define common interests shared by small rural communities with less than 100 inhabitants and world-class tourism resorts or industrialised communities with more than 5000 inhabitants, variety among Alpine municipalities can also be regarded as a particular strength of the network. The network in practice The network regularly organises national and international workshops and conferences that provide important opportunities for direct interaction between municipal leaders. Many new ideas are born at these events, and projects initiated. However, the most important benefit is exchange of experience. What is important is the professional follow-up that the network provides to its members. Experts from the network are facilitators and thus fill the gap between formulation of stimulating National and regional experience 31 \"Direct benefits for us\" \"The Val Lumnezia had already embarked on a sustainable development path prior to the establishment of the network. But we joined the Alliance as we wanted to further improve our projects. The network provides us with access to experience in other municipalities and to material already available in other parts of the Alps. It is also important to know people and to be informed in a timely manner about new initiatives that may be of interest to our community.\" Statement of Silvio Capeder, who for ten years has been the president of Cumbel, a small village in the Swiss Alps, and is now the manager of the \"Val Lumnezia\" project. ideas and embarking on concrete projects. Collaboration creates new capacities for sustainable development. Among other things, the participating communities have the right to use a specific label, recognised across Europe, which increases their competitiveness, though only on a formal level. What has been achieved In its few years of existence, the \"Alliance in the Alps\" has achieved a number of results. More than 70 projects have been initiated using a bottom-up approach. An impressive innovative capacity is developing in the competitive environment of the network as a result of this process. A report on the first five years of the network, including a list of projects, can be ordered from the secretariat of the parent association (r.siegele@maeder.at). The projects relate to, and link together the following areas of activity: sustainable tourism, agriculture, forestry, energy, transport, nature protection, and economy.

(Alpenbro) 32 Sustainable Development in Mountain Areas The village of Corippo in the Verzasca valley, Switzerland, was more or less abandoned in the 1970s, though it is located only about 25 km from the tourist centres of Locarno and Ascona. (P. Walther) Europe: Switzerland A compensation fund to support development in mountain areas For the last six decades, Switzerland has followed a policy designed to avoid widespread depopulation of its mountain areas that would also have led to severe ecological problems. First, farmers and forestry operations in the mountains received subsidies and sectoral infrastructure programmes as compensation for the disadvantages they face when competing with lowland farmers. Second, an umbrella law (IHG) was passed in 1975 to provide loans for small investment projects in mountain communities. To gain access to the IHG, the politically independent mountain communities must organise themselves into so-called development (IHG) regions and reach consensus on their development priorities. Origins and objectives of the IHG The late 1960s were years of economic growth. The Swiss government was therefore inclined to think about a more equitable distribution of economic benefits between better-off areas and marginal areas found mostly in the mountains. The main political objective was to ensure that mountain areas would not be depopulated rapidly, and that mountain agriculture would not collapse due to the impact of modernisation. This objective was to be achieved \"It is not possible to start something new without taking a certain risk. We should have the courage to take this risk. I think that it can be calculated and managed.\" Statement of Federal Councillor Brugger during a debate in the Swiss Parliament, in November 1973, on the IHG and whether it should be established as an expression of solidarity by the Swiss population with its mountain areas. with a broad-based loan programme, under an umbrella law providing a Swiss Investment Fund (IHG) for mountain areas. This law was passed by the Parliament in 1975. Establishing development regions To become eligible for the soft loans provided by this law, communities had to be classified according to topographic criteria as `mountain communities' and collaborate in `development regions' organised as private associations by the communities. By 1983, 54 such development regions, composed of 1225 municipalities, had been registered by the federal government. The IHG also provided the new associations with funds to establish small secretariats. The first task of each development region was to prepare an integrated development plan. The plans identified the individual development projects for which funding was sought through the IHG. They also had to National and regional experience 33 Opportunities for learning The Swiss experience with the IHG could also be relevant to other social compensation funds, for example in many countries of South America (funded by the World Bank and other donors). The key principles are: (a) bottom-up organisation; (b) local and participatory decision-making and planning; (c) demand-driven; (d) significant (financial) contribution from benefiting communities. address issues of nature and landscape protection, in accordance with national legislation. The fact that the IHG regions were partially in competition with each other helped put the process on track relatively quickly. 25 years of achievement By 1991, 3078 development projects had been co-funded by the IHG, and the imbalance in basic service infrastructure between mountain and lowland areas had been reduced. The population increased by 10% between 1970 and 1990. At a more psychological level, involving recognition of the mountains as specific development areas, the impacts were perhaps even more sustainable. While the municipalities initially found it difficult to organise themselves into `development regions' and agree on setting boundaries or development objectives, they soon overcame these problems and began to collaborate more effectively. This was a very important achievement, as the level of decentralisation and local autonomy is extremely high in Switzerland for historical reasons. The regional secretariats are important focal and entry points for all business and public sector contacts, including potential investors. To further strengthen their new roles, a national organisation of the regional development secretariats was established in 1993. Its main objective is to facilitate exchange of experience and collaboration between the development regions. more effective and sustainable than projects which focus too narrowly on basic services for mountain people. Through wise investments, the IHG can help create new jobs in the mountains. Examples include projects to buy land for business development, investments in tourism infrastructure such as thermal bath centres, congress or sport facilities.

Kohler) 34 Sustainable Development in Mountain Areas The valleys of the Western Pamir are dotted with villages where the population engages mainly in irrigated farming, under severe topographic and climatic constraints. Developing additional economic opportunities is a crucial issue in negotiations for a strategy aiming at sustainable mountain development. (Ch. Hergarten) Central Asia: Tajikistan Generating knowledge for development in the Pamir mountains The collapse of the Soviet Union brought independence to the Republics of Central Asia. The transition from planned economy to market economy has brought profound changes that have had a particularly heavy impact on marginal mountain areas. In the Tajik Pamir, characterised by increasing poverty and dependence on external humanitarian support, the Pamir Strategy Project aims to promote sustainable mountain development by generating knowledge about the status and trends of selected sectors and negotiating a strategic vision for the region. The Pamir mountains cover parts of Afghanistan, China, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan. The heart of the Pamir is the Gorno Badakshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO) of Tajikistan, a 70,000 km2 area, with peaks rising to 7400 m. This remarkable landscape is dominated by high plateaus in the east, and deep valleys with glaciers and traditional settlements on alluvial fans in the west. The arid climate and low levels of human disturbance in these sparsely populated moun- tains have given rise to a remarkable diversity of plants and animals. Transformation in the Tajik Pamir Reality for most people in the Tajik Pamir contrasts with visitors' first impressions of a human and natural paradise. After Tajikistan's independence, the Soviet Union cut off considerable subsidies for energy, food, and infrastructure. Almost immediately, in 1992, a civil war broke out in Tajikistan, bringing many refugees to the GBAO, which was not directly involved. Both developments brought the region to the edge of humanitarian catastrophe. Famine was only avoided through massive relief efforts undertaken by the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN), which are still continuing. The region is characterised by increasing poverty, structural economic problems, and decaying infrastructure. From 1995 to 2000, the number of jobs was cut in half; unemployment among the region's 200,000 inhabitants now exceeds 20 %. Barter trade has practically replaced the former cash economy. Pressure on natural resources has also increased, as arable land is very limited. Energy supplies are minimal, and the region's few trees and bushes are cut to replace fossil fuel. A fragile peace within Tajikistan and with its neighbours, combined with isolation due to the remote location and the limited and unreliable transportation links, poses major hurdles for development. Yet the region has obvious potential which remains largely unexploited. This includes rich natural resources, such as minerals and the potential for hydropower; scenic beauty attractive for tourism; and relatively high levels of education due to the unifying cultural National and regional experience 35 orientation of the Ismaili culture of Shia Islam. Full exploitation of this potential will require a transport and communication infrastructure for regional integration. Developing a knowledge base Promoting sustainable development in the GBAO is a great political, economic, social, and ecological challenge. As part of its programme for the IYM, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation is supporting a strategy to address this challenge. One prerequisite is a knowledge system to provide information about the status, trends, and mechanisms of the social and ecological systems. To begin accumulating the necessary knowledge, baseline information was gathered through participatory fieldwork in selected villages and high pastures in the summer of 2001, in cooperation with the AKDN and the Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development. This work emphasised the living conditions and perceptions of villagers and herders. To complement this information, remotely sensed data, data on natural resources and socio-economic data were incorporated in a Geographic Information System. ment strategy, with active involvement and broad participation by local, provincial, national, and international stakeholders. The workshop will enhance knowledge about the Tajik Pamir for all participants, provide a platform to achieve joint visions, and negotiate a path towards sustainable development. Thomas Breu, Hans Hurni Left: In the Eastern Pamir, high plains extend over a vast area at an average altitude of 3500 m. This area is used by the Kyrgyz minority, who let their yak herds graze during the summer months. The Pamir Strategy Project is examining the option of expanding the use of these pastures while also taking account of the limitations imposed by conservation of the unique biodiversity. (J. Hangartner) Right: The Pamir mountains are marked by extreme remoteness. This narrow road, carved out of the rocks, connects Gorno Badakshan with Tajikistan's capital, Dushanbe, a distance that requires a two-day journey. (E. Kleinn) Knowledge about selected topics should establish a basis for negotiations among development stakeholders. The process should ultimately lead to a sound and well-adapted strategic vision for the Tajik Pamir mountains. (T. Breu) Participatory strategy negotiations Based on the information and knowledge acquired in summer 2001, problems relating to natural resources, land use, socio-economy, and governance were identified. Initial visions for further development, as well as options and constraints, were then outlined. A workshop will be held in the GBAO to ensure a sound and widely accepted develop- Building on a transdisciplinary approach The process of knowledge generation and strategy development benefits from the transdisciplinary mode of work, which brings together experts from various disciplines and government offices, and most importantly, the people living in the project area. Multiple outcomes will ensue, including an information database to be used for planning, education and monitoring; a common knowledge base arising from involved stakeholders; and a strategy to improve the livelihoods of mountain people in a well-preserved environment. 36 Sustainable Development in Mountain Areas Central Asia: Kyrgyzstan Rural development through investments in community-based tourism Kyrgyzstan, until recently largely unknown outside the CIS countries, is now becoming a destination for adventure and cultural tourism. During the 1990s, tourism development was mostly managed by private tour operators based in the capital city. To counter this imbalance, the concept of community-based tourism has been introduced. The beautiful mountain landscape of the Tien Shan along the Silk Road is an important asset for tourism development. A community-based approach guarantees that the income generated by tourism benefits local communities. (Helvetas) Most of Kyrgyzstan is above 2500 m. The Tien Shan mountain range, containing high peaks such as Victory Peak and Hantengri (both over 7000 m) divides the country into two distinct parts. Northern Kyrgyzstan includes Lake Issyk-Kul, at 1600 m the second largest mountain lake in the world after Lake Titicaca, and is mostly populated by Kyrgyz, Russians, Chinese, and Koreans all in minority groupings. Southern Kyrgyzstan is mainly populated by Kyrgyz and Uzbeks. Kyrgyzstan's rich and diverse cultural heritage stems from the nomadic lifestyle of its people and its location on the Great Silk Road to China. The Year of Tourism (2001) as a starting point for policy reforms The Kyrgyz Republic is a country still undergoing political and economic transition. Emphasising the importance of tourism for the country's economic development, President Akaev declared 2001 the Year of Tourism. The state administration put considerable effort into tourism marketing but owing to various adverse factors, including Tourism a state priority in Kyrgyzstan The tourism industry, still a fledgling sector in the economy, has become a priority concern for the Kyrgyz government. A 10year action plan concentrates on developing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in tourism, abolishing bureaucracy, and promoting (foreign) investment through a conducive legal framework of privatisation, tax reduction, a state policy for destination marketing, and a state-run Tourism Promotion Board. terrorist threats and the September 11th incident, the increase in tourism was marginal and certainly not of the magnitude expected. Other negative factors are the poor quality of services and high prices in relation to the quality of the state-run tourism services. As a result of these shortcomings, President Akaev's administration has devised a 10-year tourism development plan focusing on marketing, infrastructure, tourism education, improvement of quality, and control and privatisation of state-run resorts. For instance, only 16% of the resorts around Lake Issyk-Kul had been privatised by 2000. This situation is changing, but painfully slowly, due in part to excessive bureaucracy and vested interests. Hopefully, a comprehensive strategy, supportive national and regional policies, and cooperation between the private and state tourism sectors will make tourism a major economic sector, although it is still at an early stage. Community Based Tourism (CBT) Tourism development in the ten years since independence has been managed by private tour operators, mostly situated in the capital city of Bishkek. Due to interest in the Silk Road and the mountainous landscape, tour National and regional experience 37 operators have had an annual growth rate of 1025%, with most tourism-related business and profits generated in Bishkek. To counter this imbalance, community-based tourism (CBT) has been introduced and developed by an international NGO, with the goal of generating income in rural Kyrgyzstan. The project, which started in 1999, offers capacity building and marketing support to local tourism providers in rural and mountain areas. There are now seven CBT groups in different locations. Each group is self-managed and has received hospitality, tourism, and business-related training or specifically outsourced service providers, such as tour operators. A self-managed quality-monitoring system helps to maintain high-quality, adapted standards. Community Based Tourism (CBT) in brief In its ideal form, CBT is initiated and operated by local tourism providers or stakeholders in harmony with their traditional culture and responsible for the stewardship of their land. In tourism development, community participation provides means through which local control and ownership can be maintained and the following local concerns can be addressed: (a) conservation of natural resources; (b) improvement of the socio-economic situation; (c) conservation of historical and cultural resources; and (d) more effective planning and implementation, and monitoring of tourism activities. Horseback riding guides in Kyrgyzstan are an example of microenterprise creation in remote mountain areas. (K. Feg) Integration and networking for better marketing In order to advertise, publicise and expand their activities and facilities, it is necessary to link tourism providers to external niche markets of eco-tourism and cultural tourism. The CBT groups actively cooperate with a tourism CBT in practice in Kyrgyzstan Annual tourism planning and evaluation workshops are conducted independently by the CBT group members in seven sites. Action plans also include indicators to evaluate success and sustainability of tourism actions. Tourist information centres in four locations are self-managed by CBT groups. They inform incoming tourists about tourism services. Pricing and quality control in CBT sites foster greater tourist satisfaction. CBT groups enforce standardisation of facilities, minimum prices, and control of services. CBT group members elect coordinators in each location with the aim of coordinating and achieving common results and building capacity for joint actions. CBT groups manage a fund created from commissions on tourist services. Examples of micro-enterprises in CBT locations include trekking and horseback riding guides, interpreters, and drivers who will take care of the guests once they have reached a CBT site. development company in Bishkek. In its third year of operation, the company is already viable and profitable, marketing CBT services abroad mostly in Switzerland, Germany, France, and the Netherlands. This collaboration was essential in promoting CBT services abroad and making CBT services available to package holidaymakers and individual tourists in the West. From 2002, the seven CBT groups are establishing a national CBT association aimed at unifying quality standards, joint marketing, and lobbying for rural community-based tourism at the national level. Karin Feg Tourism is a state priority in Kyrgyzstan. Investments in Community-Based Tourism include capacity building, marketing, and business-related training. Today seven CBT groups are about to create a national CBT association to ensure uniform standards of quality and undertake joint marketing and lobbying at the national level. (K. Feg) 38 Sustainable Development in Mountain Areas Asia: Vietnam New challenges for sectoral policy making and planning in an economy in transition Bao Loc District in the Central Highlands of southern Vietnam is one of the best areas in the world for silk farming and production. Recently, US$ 18 million was invested to modernise the state-owned silk processing factory. Yet silk production has declined rapidly to around 10% of what was targeted in government plans. A pilot project was undertaken to determine how this could be related to policy issues and the deficiencies of the heavily centralised government planning system. The project's results are relevant to many transition countries moving towards a market economy. Numerous economic and ecological benefits could be achieved if the agricultural planning system were modernised. The state-owned enterprise, VISERI, continues to operate according to sectoral plans which are elaborated without consultation with stakeholders. Production targets are output-oriented and not balanced with inputs and programmes needed to achieve them. The logic of a business plan is still a novelty for VISERI. (B. Wiedmer) Government planning in a state economy In the initial phase of the study, a representative of the local Department of Planning and Investment (DPI) described his problems: \"Only around 10% of the targets for the silk industry and the socio-economic plans that we have defined in our sector will be met, despite the fact that Bao Loc is one of the best areas in the world for sericulture. We have invested around US$ 18 million in the local state-owned silk processing plant (VISERI), but VISERI complains about a lack of raw material, as farmers are increasingly moving into coffee plantations. These plantations cause soil erosion on steep slopes, which is not sustainable in the long run. What should we do to improve our planning system?\" This final question reflects the logic of the old state-controlled economy in which the government, the only investor in the country, was perceived as responsible for solving every problem. The government still prepares numerous socio-economic and sectoral plans, with little involvement of stakeholders. The draft plans are submitted at the national level for final decisions about public investment and targets. Many plans demonstrate a lack of clarity about the ways and means of achieving targets and objectives. There is also a lack of coordination between the different sectoral plans. Challenges in a market economy Today, in a market economy, farmers' decisions regarding investment in long-term perennial cash crops are no longer under the complete control of the government or VISERI. Farmers make alternative investment decisions, based on their own perceptions of demand, input, and familiarity with a technology package for efficient management of such investments. As mulberry production The silk industry creates jobs Reviving the silk sector could pave the way for sustainable development in Bao Loc in the Central Highlands of southern Vietnam. One of the main advantages of sericulture is that it is very labourintensive and can provide gainful employment to large numbers of rural residents. National and regional experience 39 Mr Nguyen Xuan Kien, Director of the Lam Dong Department of Planning and Investment (DPI), about the pilot project: \"This project has already brought several benefits to Lamdong. First, economic evaluation confirms that there is great potential for development of the silk industry. Development of this sector will bring socio-economic benefits as well as solutions for the employment problem, which is very severe. Second, public meetings with farmers and stakeholders helped them to gain a comprehensive understanding of the silk sector. They came to understand which parts of the system need strengthening.\" and silk worm rearing is not perceived as very profitable, coffee is replacing more traditional production in the area. Discussions with farmers revealed many opportunities for improving farming technology in sericulture. It was estimated that with more suitable technology packages such as those used in China or in Thailand, Bao Loc's farmers could triple their return per hectare, making sericulture once again very attractive for further investment. At the same time, soil erosion could be minimised. The present government planning system is not responding to such challenges. Instead of setting socio-economic and sectoral targets, it would be more profitable and effective for the government to concentrate on its core responsibilities such as defining a policy for sericulture development, agricultural research, and dissemination of information through agricultural extension services. The current planning system adds virtually no value to sericulture in Bao Loc. New role for sectoral policies? The study established, for the first time, a provincial platform for discussing the abovementioned problems and elaborating possible solutions, in a spirit of collaboration between all stakeholders including DPI, VISERI, and representatives of farming associations. The government played a facilitating role, and the platform was seen as having the potential to develop into a new planning approach at the district or provincial level. The landscape of Bao Loc District, Lam Dong Province: an unimproved mulberry variety at an early stage of growth can be seen in the foreground. (B. Wiedmer) One of the first local (provincial level) platforms was established for direct discussion of particular development issues relevant to the silk industry in Bao Loc with the stakeholders concerned (farmers, planners, VISERI). (D. Ellingson) However, the results still require political discussion. This analysis showed that maintaining a high level of central government control makes it difficult, especially in remote mountain areas, to address local development issues in a concrete fashion. What is required from the national government is not more or better planning but rather a sectoral policy that clarifies the roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders in development VISERI, the sericulture research institute, the private sector, agricultural extension services, farmers and that defines a regulatory framework for environmental issues. Bernhard Wiedmer, Dennis Ellingson Below: An improved highyield mulberry variety, with proper planting density, for optimal production, soil protection, and erosion control. (B. Wiedmer) Introduction of new concepts in a market economy The relationship between the capacity of agricultural extension services and development of sericulture is not yet understood. As VISERI is not accountable to farming associations but only to the national government, it is increasingly investing in tourism and other operations instead of promoting sericulture. There is also no legal basis that allows VISERI to sign contracts with farming associations to secure supplies of raw material. 40 Sustainable Development in Mountain Areas Asia: Japan The Mountain Village Development Act and its impacts on sector policies Most of Japan is mountainous land, mainly covered by forests which have various important functions in this highly industrialised country. Mountain communities ensure that their forests are managed in a sustainable way, but they have been partially neglected by national policy makers. In 1965, in response to the problems of depopulation of mountain villages, the Japanese government approved the Mountain Village Development Act. One of the aims of this act is to eliminate socio-economic differences between mountain and lowland areas. Below: Mt. Fuji from a distance. Volcanic landscapes are an important feature of mountain areas in Japan. (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Japan) Right: Education in the forest. Children measuring the size of a tree, Hokkaido. (M. Sato) As in many parts of the world, the mountain areas in Japan lack well-developed transportation and communication infrastructure and adequate social services. As local economies are often weak, mountain areas face the serious problems of depopulation and ageing. Young people migrate from these areas, particularly in countries with vibrant economies such as Japan. An integrated approach... The villages targeted by the 1965 Act are those in need of development, located in mountainous areas with high forest cover and declining population. The main objectives of the Act are: 1. To improve communication among mountain villages, and between mountain and lowland populations, through transportation and telecommunication infrastructure; 2. To ensure that mountain land, forest, and water resources are effectively exploited through such measures as road construction, electric power generation, and improvement of agricultural land; 3. To strengthen local industries and increase employment in mountain areas through measures such as the establishment of modern forest management and farming systems, development of processing industries for agricultural and primary forestry products, introduction of tourism, and the cultivation of markets for unique, local products; 4. To control erosion and prevent natural hazards such as landslides and avalanches, by maintaining and conserving forests and key infrastructure; 5. To increase access to social services by building schools, hospitals, clinics, cultural centres, and other facilities, in order to generally improve living and working conditions. ...implemented through sectoral programmes Within the framework of this law, 12 ministries and government agencies have adopted and implemented specific policies and programmes. Recently, the 1964 Forest and Forestry Act was revised to better reflect the changes that have taken place in the mountain areas. This was a form of recognition of the long experi- National and regional experience 41 ence of the Japan Forest Agency in undertaking projects to revive mountain villages, such as preservation activities and educational programmes. But the sustainable development of mountain areas requires a multidisciplinary approach. While the Mountain Village Development Act covers mainly the social and the economic aspects of mountain development, environmental aspects are addressed by other policies and laws, such as the Basic Environment Plan and the Nature Conservation Law. Some mountain areas are also protected by other laws, such as the Natural Parks Law, the Forest Law, and the Cultural Properties and Protection Law. Greater cooperation among sectors Though no specific institution currently deals with mountain issues, Japan is committed to a comprehensive and integrated approach to sustainable development of its mountain areas. 12 ministries and government agencies are working together to achieve this goal, and close cooperation among them is increasingly essential. They hold regular discussions on both the planning and implementation of their policies and programmes. Without this collaboration, individual ministries and agencies will not be able to meet the overall goal of sustainable development in mountain areas.

Within the framework of the Mountain Village Development Act passed in 1965, 12 ministries and government agencies have adopted and implemented specific policies and programmes. Environmental aspects are addressed by other laws, and through the Ministry of Environment. (Source: M. Sato) 42 Sustainable Development in Mountain Areas The introduction of the national forest law in the mid 1930s declared forests, which were previously owned and managed by the community, to be state property. Deforestation was induced by the selling of logging rights to external contractors. Interventions in this fragile environment were so drastic that forests did not regenerate. Local people were even forced to extract dead tree trunks for firewood. A new national policy aiming at the rehabilitation of these degraded forest areas and restoration of responsibility to the local communities could be a promising way of reversing negative trends and moving towards sustainable development. (D. Maselli) Africa: Morocco Elaborating a policy framework for conservation and mountain development To respond to the challenge of Chapter 13 of Agenda 21, and also to the need to conserve forests subject to degradation, Morocco's Ministry of Water and Forest, in coordination with other departments concerned, began in 1999 to draft a policy framework for conservation and integrated development of the country's mountain areas. This process led to the adoption of a strategy for protection and development of these areas. It also had an important impact in promoting recognition of the importance of mountains. A broad focus Morocco's mountains cover about a quarter of the nation's total land area. A series of studies and plans conducted at the national level have concluded that the mountains have significant potential in terms of natural resources; that their economic, ecological, and social systems are fragile; and that there is a need to formulate a specific policy for mountain development. To respond to these insights and the increasing threat of degradation of mountain forests, the national forestry programme recommended the drafting of a policy and a law for protection and integrated development of the country's mountains. There was broad consensus that the policy should not be limited to strategies and measures at the technical and/or administrative level. Increasingly, the need became clear for a policy to mobilise the government administration and local communities and actors, in a voluntary and participatory manner. One objective of the process was to create national solidarity to benefit the mountains and their integration into national policy. The process of consensus building The first step was establishment of an interministerial task force on the initiative of the Ministry of Water and Forest. This resulted in various working groups that included both technical staff and representatives of research institutes and NGOs. The process received financial and technical support from the French government. Workshops were held on topics such as delineation of mountain areas, agricultural development, commercialisation, the handi- National and regional experience 43 Remote mountain areas often suffer from outmigration to modern urban centres. However, newly built terraces still lacking bush and tree cover are positive signs that people intend to stay and that they believe in the future of their traditional livelihood. (D. Maselli) craft sector, tourism, transport and access, natural resources, social services, institutional instruments for mountain development, and financial and economic regulatory frameworks for implementing strategies. The process also included meetings in the field with local authorities and leaders as well as elected officials, with the further aim of establishing processes of mutual learning, improving problem analysis, and increasing public awareness of the process. Both workshops and meetings in the field allowed the government to define a realistic strategy for the protection and integrated development of mountain areas. Innovative elements in the policy framework The framework had two main objectives: decreasing the social and economic imbalance between mountain areas and the rest of the country, and combating poverty by stimulating local self-governance. These broad objectives were addressed by the following strategy: promotion of a territorial approach, to pro- vide mountain areas with a socio-economic framework that favours the organisation of communities for the management of their natural resources; integration of sectoral policies and activities concerned with basic social needs in a new partnership, to ensure greater stakeholder involvement; adoption of a partnership and a participatory approach for the conservation of natural resources; incentives to increase national solidarity on behalf of mountain areas. The strategy was adopted by the Inter-ministerial Council on Sustainable Development. Preliminary conclusions Consultation about the drafting of the law for conservation and integrated development of mountain areas is also underway, and a high commission has begun implementation of elements of the policy framework. One crucial issue was that the particularities of different mountain areas, or massifs, must be taken into account when defining and implementing concrete measures, orders, guidelines, and regulations. At this concrete level, the involvement of the local stakeholders will be essential. Ghanam Mohamed, Hammou Jader The Atlas Mountains cover much of Morocco and are home to about 20% of the total population. Accessibility is still poor, and in particular young people tend to leave for the cities. They are thus no longer available to help maintain the traditional terraced landuse system. A comprehensive development policy for mountain areas must therefore include provisions that make it possible to connect these remote areas with the modern world by means of roads, electricity, telecommunication, sanitation, and health services. (D. Maselli) 44 Sustainable Development in Mountain Areas Livestock husbandry is an integral part of livelihood strategies in the highlands of Lesotho. Especially the wetlands, which provide a perennial water supply, are used as valuable grazing areas. (M. Nsser) Africa: Lesotho Water policy and management: trade-offs between mountains and downstream areas Water is the principal natural resource that the land-locked Kingdom of Lesotho sells to its neighbour, South Africa. In the 1980s South Africa's apartheid government signed an agreement with the military regime in Lesotho to build the massive Lesotho Highlands Water Project. Two of five large dams have now been completed. The project has brought water revenues, hydroelectric power, and major infrastructure to Lesotho and water to Gauteng Province, the metropolitan and industrial centre of South Africa. While the benefits to South Africa are clear, the mountain people of Lesotho have lost arable and grazing land, and remote mountain communities have experienced major changes. The mountain Kingdom of Lesotho: water tower for southern Africa The Kingdom of Lesotho, one of the poorest countries in Africa, is completely surrounded by the Republic of South Africa, the continent's most powerful nation. Sometimes referred to as the \"Kingdom in the Sky\", the Lesotho Highlands receive the greatest amount of rainfall in the region and are the origin of some of the most important rivers in southern Africa. Whereas South Africa dominates almost all spheres of economic and political relations between the two countries, the peripheral mountain kingdom has been able to market one asset to the South African lowlands: its water. The Lesotho Highlands Water Project is the largest civil engineering project in subSaharan Africa. This gigantic inter-basin transfer scheme is designed to divert about 50% of the water of the southwest-flowing Senqu River (Orange River in South Africa) north into the Vaal River system for use in the province of Gauteng, which includes the major cities of Johannesburg and Pretoria (some 7 million people altogether), and the Witwatersrand, which contains about 50% of South Africa's industry and generates almost 80% of its mining output. The Lesotho Highlands Water Project appears to meet the crucial requirement of sufficient water availability for further urban expansion and industrial development. The governments that signed the contract for the Lesotho Highlands Water Project in 1986 were South Africa's apartheid government and a military regime in Lesotho, at a time when downstream Namibia was governed by the United Nations Council. The present democratic government of South Africa also recognises the importance of the project, since for example the promise of more equal distribution of water supply requires higher quantities of water for the large townships. Managing white gold ... Diverting this amount of water into a different watershed requires several dams and reservoirs, a series of pumping plants, and interconnecting tunnels blasted through the Highlands. The entire project consists of six proposed dams, 225 km of water transfer tunnels, the 72-megawatt Muela hydropower station, and construction or upgrading of 650 km of roads. It is expected to cost US$ 8 billion by the time it is completed in 2020. Plans for the inter-basin water transfer scheme were agreed in 1986 and construction started in 1991 with the first large dam, Katse (1950 million cubic metres), delivering water in 1997. At present, Mohale, the second large dam (958 million cubic metres), is nearly completed. Further project phases will involve the construction of additional dams at Mashai, Tsoelike, and Ntoahae. However, the viability of the last three phases will be reconsidered, as growing concerns about serious economic, social, and ecological impacts have been expressed by various actors, including the World Bank. Whereas South Africa receives all of the water from the project, Lesotho receives annual payments for the sale of water. This will be its largest single source of foreign exchange and is expected to boost the country's economy by US$ 40 million annually. Moreover, Lesotho receives hydroelectric power from the Muela plant and massive infrastructure in the form of roads and transmission lines. From the perspective of modernisation, these are important development incentives. While the capital, Maseru, and other urban areas in the lowlands of Lesotho have become independent of other power supplies, the mountain communities in the upper tributaries do not benefit from the new hydropower, as most of the high altitude catchment areas have not yet been connected to transmission lines. ... for whose benefit? The project is managed by the Lesotho Highlands Development Authority, a semigovernmental organisation responsible for resettlement and compensation issues, environmental protection, and overall construction management. Critics of the controversial highland-lowland project point to developmental and environmental problems such as the prospective loss of thousands of hectares of arable or grazing land, the involuntary resettlement of 2000 people, and dramatic changes experienced by formerly remote mountain communities, combined with insufficient and delayed compensation for the loss of grazing land, fuelwood, and thatch grasses. Moreover, the high expectations of nonagrarian income opportunities for the local population of the Lesotho Highlands have not been fulfilled. Environmental concerns include the serious effects on downstream drainage patterns, such as reductions of water availability and wetlands, as well as other ecological consequences. These concerns led to huge protests over the large dams in Lesotho, and the realisation of further project phases is bound to be controversial.

McMechan) Below: Action-packed Indian rodeo is popular with tribal members of all ages. (D. McMechan) North America: United States How the people of the Warm Springs Indian Reservation defined their own policy Strong tribal leadership and an insistence on receiving fair value for natural resources have seen the Warm Springs Indian Reservation through difficult times. Through capable decision-making coupled with persistence, a long-term outlook, deliberate diversification, and an ability to adapt to changing circumstances, the Warm Springs Indians have created a homeland that offers decent jobs as well as cultural richness and landscape beauty. Indian reservations: a unit for policy formulation Ancestors of the people of Warm Springs are believed to have occupied what is now Oregon for at least 11,000 years. As a result of the westward expansion of white settlers, a treaty was signed in 1855 between the tribes of middle Oregon and the US government. This treaty ceded 4 million hectares of land in return for the equivalent of US$ 150,000 in tools, clothing, provisions, salaries, and the right to continue fishing at traditional sites. Over half a million acres of forest and range mountain land on the edge of their traditional range were set aside as the Warm Springs Indian Reservation, where several tribes, including the Wasco, Walla Walla, and Paiute, were forced to relocate. Leadership, committed to a vision Many Indian reservations have lost much of their area or have been terminated since their establishment more than a century ago. Warm Springs is lucky to have had leaders who effectively fought the many attempts to reduce the size of their reservation including privatisation and subsequent re-sale to non-Indians, inaccurate surveys, and frequent changes in the legal status of reservation land. In 1957, a major setback the loss of traditional salmon fishing sites on the Columbia River, due to flooding caused by The Dalles The People's Plan, 1999 Nearly one quarter of the 4000 members of the Warm Springs Indian Reservation participated directly in developing a comprehensive plan that goes beyond economic goals to consider what is good for their culture and the health of their community. The 20-year plan is not a dry bureaucratic document but rather a keepsake book, in a customised binder for each household. The whole idea is to have a plan that families keep and value. In the words of planner Jolene Atencio, \"Our sovereignty is based on us knowing our culture.\" National and regional experience 47 dam was turned to advantage. The tribes negotiated a US$ 4 million settlement from the US Army Corps of Engineers, and proceeded to invest this money wisely in their own future. Rather than distributing the entire settlement among tribal members as is commonly done the money was held in trust for the reservation as a whole. The development path of diversification The first big expenditure was an Oregon State College study of the reservation's natural and human resources and their potential for sustainable economic development. This study, adopted in 1959, has proved to be a key investment in developing land policies to preserve the integrity of the reservation. Deliberate diversification led to investment in a number of economic activities, about half of which were successful. Today, the fruits of this policy include a forest products industry, a luxury resort, a hydroelectric plant, rental monies from two utility-owned dams, and cattle ranching. The reservation is filled with young people, and a lively museum/cultural A vision for development \"We the people of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, since time immemorial, carry forth the inherent rights of sovereignty and spirituality through unity and a respect for the land, water, each other and the many gifts given by the Creator.\" The People's Plan, 1999 Putting tribal values at the centre \"In my work with the community over the past five years, I have learned the importance of having our inherent tribal values be the heart of our plans. I feel we need to be very selective in adopting non-tribal models, laws, and policies. If models are adopted, we need to be sure they are `alignable' with tribalism. This will be one of our biggest challenges, since much of our governmental success was built upon non-tribal structures and thinking. Professionally, I have had to learn the tribal thinking to begin to distinguish the difference. I thank my tribal people for these lessons.\" (Jolene E. Atencio, planner and coordinator for the \"The People's Plan\" for Warm Springs, as well as an enrolled tribal member) centre celebrates the cultures of the tribes, both past and present. The tribal organisation continues to work toward effective governance, including clarity in its own relationships, roles, and responsibilities. In 1999, a People's Plan was elaborated, which further bundles development under the vision of sustainable development.

McMechan) Common lessons to be learned This example demonstrates how a relatively independent territorial entity, an Indian reservation, can succeed in defining, within the legal boundaries of its autonomy, its own vision and policy, for the benefit of sustainable development. Clearly, such examples can have a positive impact on the policy discussions as a whole. They can become true pioneers of sustainable development in mountain areas.

McMechan) 48 Sustainable Development in Mountain Areas Development of resourcebased industries (logging, mining) began in the late 19th century, overwhelmingly with a sectoral focus, and with little concern about environmental impacts. (Calgary, Historic Archive) North America: Canada Integrated Resource Management (IRM) as a policy for public lands management Most of the mountainous area of western North America consists of public lands managed by government agencies. Several decades ago, the provincial government of Alberta, Canada, adopted the \"philosophy\" of Integrated Resource Management (IRM) for management of the many valuable natural resources on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains. Today, IRM continues with the same objectives: integration and sustainable development. But IRM strategies have evolved in order to make the concept more effective. IRM since 1977 The eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains of Alberta, Canada, cover an area of roughly 90,000 km2 of mountains and forested foothills. The region supports forestry, oil and gas development, mining, tourism and recreation, and forms the headwaters of the prairies' major rivers. The land is owned and managed by the public sector, providing an opportunity to Economic aspects Revenues from royalties and bids for resource use titles are significant for the Alberta government, but they are also subject to fluctuations. In 1980, they amounted to about 50% of the provincial budget, in 2000 to only about 20%. manage land and resources for the public good. Realising that opportunity balancing current benefits with opportunities for future generations is an ongoing challenge. In 1977, the Province of Alberta adopted the concept of IRM as its leading resource management philosophy in a major policy document. In order to make IRM operational, it established a programme to develop Integrated Resource Plans (IRPs). These IRPs provided integrated objectives for resource use and protection for each area. Their lasting legacy was to delineate sensitive lands and withdraw them from industrial or commercial development. The IRPs also provided a forum for the various provincial management agencies to work toward common goals. The public involvement component was advanced for its day. IRM and sustainable development In the 1990s, the IRP programme declined as provincial revenues dropped (see box) and impatience with the lengthy IRP process grew. In a slower economy, the plans were less effective in stimulating appropriate development than they had previously been in restricting inappropriate development. This decline did not, however, represent a loss of commitment to the goals for which IRM had been established. Sustainable development subsequently became a core concept, and in 1999, the provincial government released a policy statement, \"Alberta's Commitment to Sustainable Resource and Environmental Management\". This document expressed a vision of a vibrant economy and a healthy environment for all Albertans, and it set out a strategy to achieve that vision. The new policy provides high-level policy direction for sectoral policies. It also directs National and regional experience 49 Pioneering regional planning The Northern East Slopes Sustainable Resource and Environmental Management Strategy could become a model for regional planning in other areas. To date, the process has led to: (a) a regional vision, including goals and indicators; (b) the identification of important regional development issues. Simulation models are used to forecast the cumulative ecological and economic consequences of various options. Classification of Alberta's land into \"white\" and \"green areas\". The \"green areas\" were established in 1948 to withdraw forest lands from agricultural settlement. They remain almost entirely in public ownership, managed for multiple uses. (Province of Alberta) reform of the decision-making and regulatory regime, to make it more efficient and firmly based on sustainability and IRM principles. IRM: new directions Today's resource and environmental management agenda in Alberta includes a number of thematic areas: 1. Cross-government initiatives and cooperation have become the norm, as the vision of sustainable development is clearly defined at the most senior levels. Increasingly, government departments focus on this strategic level, leaving programme delivery to others. 2. Streamlining regulatory systems: a clear and efficient regulatory system is an essential element of an attractive investment climate. Today, there is a greater focus on desired outcomes, defined through planning. 3. In the past, IRM was often perceived as a necessary expense. Today, it is seen as a means to a more efficient, outcome-focused management system. 4. Cumulative effects: IRPs were good at defining where activities are not appropriate, but they were less successful in determining how such activities should take place and to what extent they could be supported in an area. Today, new management tools also address cumulative effects. 5. Many cumulative effects are regional in scale and scope, and they demand regional solutions (for example forest fires, large wildlife reserves). 6. Industry-led operational integration: Under \"command and control\" regulation, government imposed rules on each industry or company separately, specifying how they were to operate. Today, inter-industry collaboration is increasingly important. It minimises conflicts and negative environmental impacts, while also saving companies money. Regional strategies through partnership The new commitment to sustainable development also encouraged new initiatives for regional planning. In 2000, the Alberta government launched the Northern East Slopes Sustainable Resource and Environmental Management Strategy, covering an area of 40,000 km2 of mountain land. The strategy was initiated following highly contentious public hearings into a proposed new coal mine (Cheviot), to be located adjacent to Jasper National Park. The process is led by a committee of citizens and government representatives, and is considered a prototype for other strategies that may eventually cover the rest of the province. David W. Belyea Kananaski: a beautiful landscape on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains in Alberta, Canada. (D. Belyea) Improved collaboration between resource industries One good example of collaboration is coordination and sharing of road access for forestry, oil and natural gas development. Previously, each company would have constructed its own roads. 50 Sustainable Development in Mountain Areas A recent study of the Mekong region conducted by the Asian Development Bank, concluded that four out of five conflict areas involving a clash between environmental and development interests, are located in mountain areas. (T. Kohler) A call for multi-level policy initiatives and partnerships There are many ways to incorporate the principles of sustainable development into policies and instruments that promote mountain development, as illustrated by the experiences of mountain areas around the world presented in the preceding chapter. However, there is a need to enhance coherence in mountain development and to adjust policies accordingly. In order to achieve tangible results, these processes must especially take place at the national level. The National Committees that have been established for preparation of IYM2002 could be used as a platform to elaborate such processes through policy initiatives. International partnerships are needed to support national initiatives, promote the exchange of ideas and experiences, and initiate concrete programmes for mountain development. 10 years after Rio Chapter 13 of Agenda 21 of the 1992 Rio Conference identified two major programme areas: generation of knowledge about the ecology and sustainable development of mountain ecosystems, and promotion of integrated watershed development and alternative livelihood opportunities in mountain areas. Where do we stand 10 years after Chapter 13 was adopted? Significant progress has been made in acquiring knowledge of mountain ecosystems and in gaining insight into the specific challenges of mountain development. However, progress with regard to the management of mountain resources is much less impressive. Livelihoods in mountains have deteriorated in many places. Poverty is widespread. In other words, the gap between knowledge and action, between information and implementation, has widened. The coming decade should be devoted to narrowing this gap and renewing efforts to achieve tangible and lasting results in the development of mountain areas. A call for multi-level policy initiatives and partnerships 51 Inadequate policies Many countries have realised the importance of their mountain areas and have elaborated sectoral policies, laws, and regulations for the use of their resources. However, most of these instruments were formulated to serve downstream interests, a bias which permeates, for example, large hydropower and electrification plants, concessions for timber and mineral extraction, and road construction. National policies tend to disregard mountain livelihoods and local development agendas. Moreover, they do not consider the specific challenges of mountain development. These challenges are different in industrialised and developing countries, and may also differ within one and the same mountain region. However, they typically include problems such as difficult access, economic and political marginality, outmigration, environmental sensitivity, and diversity of livelihoods and cultures. In future, these problems might be compounded by increasing local, national, and transboundary conflicts over scarce mountain resources such as water, land, plant genetic resources, timber, and minerals. The need for multi-level policy initiatives and partnerships What is needed, therefore, are policies and instruments which promote mountain development from a mountain perspective, without neglecting the wider political context, Key elements and principles of a policy initiative for sustainable development in mountain areas: Recognition of mountain areas as important and specific areas of development Compensation for services rendered to surrounding downstream areas Diversification and the benefits of complementarities Exploitation of the local potential for innovation Cultural change without loss of identity Conservation of mountain ecosystems and early warning function Institutionalising sustainable development of mountain areas including downstream interests and the increasing potential for conflict over mountain resources within and between countries. Such policies and instruments will build on national and international partnerships, and involve mountain communities as equal partners. What is called for are policy initiatives that put sustainable development of mountain areas on the political agenda, consider the specific challenges of develop- ment in mountain areas, and ensure that sectoral policies are adapted to take account of these challenges and that they complement and reinforce each other, thus enhancing their effectiveness for the benefit of overall development. Guiding principles Ideas and principles that could form the basis for such policy initiatives are presented on pages 619 of the present publication. For easier reference, they are summarised in the box to the left. Countries play a key role In the contemporary world, authority for the formulation of policies and instruments rests largely with individual countries. Therefore, policy initiatives for the sustainable development of mountain areas must be initiated, formulated, and translated into Women in mountain areas often have a difficult life. Their important roles in farming and natural resource management contrast sharply with their limited rights of ownership and access to resources, education, health care, and positions of influence in many mountain communities. When formulating policy initiatives and partnerships, women must be given a voice, and their specific concerns addressed. (T. Kohler) 52 Sustainable Development in Mountain Areas Partnerships could be initiated for development of public lands, where policy formulation and implementation are less complex than for private lands. (P. Walther) Creating an enabling policy environment: a key role of the government Often, sustainable development of mountain areas can be achieved through initiatives undertaken by civil society and the private sector, including commercial cooperation. However, national policies and instruments are important for creating an enabling environment, including an adequate legal and regulatory framework. Providing such an environment must be one of the aims of national policy initiatives for mountain development. instruments and action primarily at the national level. Such policy initiatives will give coherence to laws and regulations, institutions, incentive and support systems, and specific sector programmes for mountain development within a specific country. They will help formulate effective programmes at the local level, and provide orientation for regional and transboundary cooperation between countries that share the same mountain areas. And they will provide a frame of reference for the integration and implementation of global partnerships, conventions, agreements, and laws. There is no blueprint for enacting and institutionalising policy initiatives at the national level. Each country has to find its own way, depending on its specific situation, political culture, and system of governance. The National Committees and similar mechanisms that were created by about 70 countries worldwide in preparation for IYM 2002 could serve as practical platforms to get the initiatives started. The need for broad alliances Policy initiatives elaborated in an isolated manner by national governments or any other single institution are unlikely to have concrete and lasting effects a fact that is confirmed by the case studies collected in the present publication. Thus, mountain policy initiatives need to be based on a process that involves a broad coalition of partners from the government, the private sector, and civil society. Support from the mass media and from important personalities can be useful to raise awareness among the general public and mobilise potential partners. Linking global, national, and local efforts in an international partnership for mountain development Policy initiatives for mountain development should also be initiated at the international level, with a view to supporting national initiatives, linking international, national, and local programmes for mountain develop- A call for multi-level policy initiatives and partnerships 53 Different countries different approaches Many different approaches can be taken to the institutionalisation of national policy initiatives for the development of mountain areas. For example, Morocco, Austria, France, Georgia, Poland, and Cuba are drafting an integrated policy framework for mountain development. Nepal, Japan, Bulgaria, and Colombia are incorporating a regional focus on mountain development into relevant sector policies. Source: FAO, 2002 ment, and promoting cooperation and partnership between major stakeholders such as donors, implementing agencies, NGOs, the private sector, the scientific, research, and technological communities, and mountain communities. The International Partnership for Sustainable Development in Mountain Regions is an example of such an international policy initiative. It was prepared for the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg 2002 by FAO, UNEP, and by Switzerland as a representative of the Mountain Focus Group, a group of countries that are interested in promoting mountain development. This International Partnership was conceived as an umbrella alliance under which all partners could enter into specific sub-partnerships according to their interest, competence, and willingness. Sub-partnerships could be organ- The International Partnership for Sustainable Development in Mountain Regions: an initiative linking global, national, and local actors \"The international partnership was conceived as an umbrella alliance under which all partners could enter into specific sub-partnerships according to their interest, competence and willingness.\" tive will be guided by clearly agreed goals, and their operations will be based on commitments made by partners. The Partnership will place special emphasis on transboundary cooperation. Multilateral instruments Given the transboundary character of many mountain areas, multilateral cooperation is another important instrument for achieving sustainable development, as shown by the case study on the Alpine Convention (pages 2627). Therefore, future policy initiatives taken at the international or national levels should seek to establish closer linkages with existing multilateral instruments, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR), and other instruments which are thematically or geographically related and relevant to the development of mountain areas. Potential policy platforms In preparation for the International Year of Mountains 2002, about 70 countries established National Committees or similar mechanisms to address the challenges of mountain development. These could become platforms for initiating and elaborating national policy initiatives and instruments for the development of mountain areas. ised around specific areas where action is needed, such as food security, poverty alleviation, biodiversity conservation, and other priorities, or around specific geographic regions or institutional concerns, such as mountain policy and law.

However, if this is done in accordance with agreed principles and within an accepted frame, coherent and meaningful results can be achieved. (U.

Alice's Evidence CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?' So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well. Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. 'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely true.) Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! 'I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) '--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.) Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) '--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.' Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!' (Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Do bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over. Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again. Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted! Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible. There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters. It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and see whether it's marked \"poison\" or not'; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later. However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 'What a curious feeling!' said Alice; 'I must be shutting up like a telescope.' And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; 'for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing. After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. 'Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself, rather sharply; 'I advise you to leave off this minute!' She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. 'But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, 'to pretend to be two people! Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!' Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words 'EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants. 'Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, 'and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!' She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, 'Which way? Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way. So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears 'Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); 'now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). 'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure I shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be kind to them,' thought Alice, 'or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.' And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. 'They must go by the carrier,' she thought; 'and how funny it'll seem, sending presents to one's own feet! And how odd the directions will look! ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ. HEARTHRUG, NEAR THE FENDER, (WITH ALICE'S LOVE). Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!' Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door. Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again. 'You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, 'a great girl like you,' (she might well say this), 'to go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!' But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall. After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, 'Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!' Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, 'If you please, sir--' The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go. Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: 'Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!' And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them. 'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I, and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! I'll try and say \"How doth the little--\"' and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:-- 'How doth the little crocodile Improve his shining tail, And pour the waters of the Nile On every golden scale! 'How cheerfully he seems to grin, How neatly spread his claws, And welcome little fishes in With gently smiling jaws!' 'I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, 'I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying \"Come up again, dear!\" I shall only look up and say \"Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down here till I'm somebody else\"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, 'I do wish they WOULD put their heads down! I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!' As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she was talking. 'How CAN I have done that?' she thought. 'I must be growing small again.' She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether. 'That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; 'and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, 'and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child, 'for I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare it's too bad, that it is!' As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, 'and in that case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high. 'I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. 'I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.' Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself. 'Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, 'to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.' So she began: 'O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!' (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, 'A mouse--of a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!') The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing. 'Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; 'I daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.' (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: 'Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. 'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings. 'I quite forgot you didn't like cats.' 'Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. 'Would YOU like cats if you were me?' 'Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: 'don't be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, 'and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face-- and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital one for catching mice-- oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. 'We won't talk about her any more if you'd rather not.' 'We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail. 'As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!' 'I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. 'Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?' The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: 'There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, 'I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went. So she called softly after it, 'Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!' When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, 'Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.' It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore. CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable. The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, 'I am older than you, and must know better'; and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said. At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, 'Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL soon make you dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon. 'Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, 'are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! \"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--\"' 'Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver. 'I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: 'Did you speak?' 'Not I!' said the Lory hastily. 'I thought you did,' said the Mouse. '--I proceed. \"Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable--\"' 'Found WHAT?' said the Duck. 'Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: 'of course you know what \"it\" means.' 'I know what \"it\" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said the Duck: 'it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find?' The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, '\"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. William's conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his Normans--\" How are you getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke. 'As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone: 'it doesn't seem to dry me at all.' 'In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, 'I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies--' 'Speak English!' said the Eaglet. 'I don't know the meaning of half those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!' And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly. 'What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone, 'was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.' 'What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything. 'Why,' said the Dodo, 'the best way to explain it is to do it.' (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.) First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ('the exact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was no 'One, two, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out 'The race is over!' and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, 'But who has won?' This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said, 'EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.' 'But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices asked. 'Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, 'Prizes! Prizes!' Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece all round. 'But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse. 'Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. 'What else have you got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice. 'Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly. 'Hand it over here,' said the Dodo. Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying 'We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble'; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered. Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could. The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more. 'You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice, 'and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again. 'Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing. 'It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse's tail; 'but why do you call it sad?' And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:-- 'Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, \"Let us both go to law: I will prosecute YOU.--Come, I'll take no denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I've nothing to do.\" Said the mouse to the cur, \"Such a trial, dear Sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.\" \"I'll be judge, I'll be jury,\" Said cunning old Fury: \"I'll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.\"' 'You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely. 'What are you thinking of?' 'I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly: 'you had got to the fifth bend, I think?' 'I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily. 'A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her. 'Oh, do let me help to undo it!' 'I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. 'You insult me by talking such nonsense!' 'I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice. 'But you're so easily offended, you know!' The Mouse only growled in reply. 'Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, 'Yes, please do!' but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker. 'What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter 'Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose YOUR temper!' 'Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the young Crab, a little snappishly. 'You're enough to try the patience of an oyster!' 'I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular. 'She'd soon fetch it back!' 'And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?' said the Lory. Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: 'Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for catching mice you can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!' This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, 'I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, 'Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!' On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone. 'I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a melancholy tone. 'Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!' And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story. CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself 'The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely. Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, 'Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made. 'He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran. 'How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.' As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name 'W. RABBIT' engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves. 'How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, 'to be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!' And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: '\"Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!\" \"Coming in a minute, nurse! But I've got to see that the mouse doesn't get out.\" Only I don't think,' Alice went on, 'that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!' By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time with the words 'DRINK ME,' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. 'I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself, 'whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!' It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself 'That's quite enough-- I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so much!' Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself 'Now I can do no more, whatever happens. What WILL become of me?' Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy. 'It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, 'when one wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what CAN have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a sorrowful tone; 'at least there's no room to grow up any more HERE.' 'But then,' thought Alice, 'shall I NEVER get any older than I am now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!' 'Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. 'How can you learn lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no room at all for any lesson-books!' And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen. 'Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. 'Fetch me my gloves this moment!' Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it. Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself 'Then I'll go round and get in at the window.' 'THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumberframe, or something of the sort. Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--'Pat! Pat! Where are you?' And then a voice she had never heard before, 'Sure then I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honour!' 'Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. 'Here! Come and help me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.) 'Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?' 'Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it 'arrum.') 'An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!' 'Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.' 'Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!' There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, 'Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at all!' 'Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. 'What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!' thought Alice. 'I wonder what they'll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm sure I don't want to stay in here any longer!' She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: 'Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other-- Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up at this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half high enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down! Heads below!' (a loud crash)--'Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who's to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I won't, then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to go down the chimney!' 'Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said Alice to herself. 'Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!' She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself 'This is Bill,' she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next. The first thing she heard was a general chorus of 'There goes Bill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--'Catch him, you by the hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices-- 'Hold up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell us all about it!' Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, ('That's Bill,' thought Alice,) 'Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm better now--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!' 'So you did, old fellow!' said the others. 'We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and Alice called out as loud as she could, 'If you do. I'll set Dinah at you!' There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, 'I wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any sense, they'd take the roof off.' After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, 'A barrowful will do, to begin with.' 'A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face. 'I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out, 'You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead silence. Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head. 'If I eat one of these cakes,' she thought, 'it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.' So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood. 'The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, 'is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.' It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry. An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. 'Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing. Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut. This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance. 'And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: 'I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again! Let me see--how IS it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?' The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it. She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else. CHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice. 'Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar. This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, 'I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.' 'What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly. 'Explain yourself!' 'I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, 'because I'm not myself, you see.' 'I don't see,' said the Caterpillar. 'I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very politely, 'for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.' 'It isn't,' said the Caterpillar. 'Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; 'but when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little queer, won't you?' 'Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar. 'Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice; 'all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.' 'You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. 'Who are YOU?' Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, 'I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.' 'Why?' said the Caterpillar. Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away. 'Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her. 'I've something important to say!' This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again. 'Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar. 'Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could. 'No,' said the Caterpillar. Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, 'So you think you're changed, do you?' 'I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; 'I can't remember things as I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!' 'Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar. 'Well, I've tried to say \"HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE,\" but it all came different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice. 'Repeat, \"YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,\"' said the Caterpillar. Alice folded her hands, and began:-- 'You are old, Father William,' the young man said, 'And your hair has become very white; And yet you incessantly stand on your head-- Do you think, at your age, it is right?' 'In my youth,' Father William replied to his son, 'I feared it might injure the brain; But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none, Why, I do it again and again.' 'You are old,' said the youth, 'as I mentioned before, And have grown most uncommonly fat; Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door-- Pray, what is the reason of that?' 'In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks, 'I kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box-- Allow me to sell you a couple?' 'You are old,' said the youth, 'and your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet; Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak-- Pray how did you manage to do it?' 'In my youth,' said his father, 'I took to the law, And argued each case with my wife; And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw, Has lasted the rest of my life.' 'You are old,' said the youth, 'one would hardly suppose That your eye was as steady as ever; Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose-- What made you so awfully clever?' 'I have answered three questions, and that is enough,' Said his father; 'don't give yourself airs! Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff? Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!' 'That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar. 'Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; 'some of the words have got altered.' 'It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes. The Caterpillar was the first to speak. 'What size do you want to be?' it asked. 'Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied; 'only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.' 'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar. Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper. 'Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar. 'Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,' said Alice: 'three inches is such a wretched height to be.' 'It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high). 'But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she thought of herself, 'I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily offended!' 'You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again. This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, 'One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.' 'One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to herself. 'Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight. Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand. 'And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot! She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 'Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her. 'What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice. 'And where HAVE my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?' She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves. As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings. 'Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon. 'I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly. 'Let me alone!' 'Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, 'I've tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!' 'I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said Alice. 'I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; 'but those serpents! There's no pleasing them!' Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished. 'As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the Pigeon; 'but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!' 'I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning. 'And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, 'and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!' 'But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice. 'I'm a--I'm a--' 'Well! WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon. 'I can see you're trying to invent something!' 'I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day. 'A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt. 'I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONE with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a serpent; and there's no use denying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!' 'I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very truthful child; 'but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.' 'I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; 'but if they do, why then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.' This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, 'You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a serpent?' 'It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; 'but I'm not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want YOURS: I don't like them raw.' 'Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height. It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. 'Come, there's half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to another! However, I've got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. 'Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, 'it'll never do to come upon them THIS size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!' So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high. CHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen. The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, 'For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.' The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, 'From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.' Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together. Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky. Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked. 'There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, 'and that for two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.' And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces. 'Please, then,' said Alice, 'how am I to get in?' 'There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went on without attending to her, 'if we had the door between us. For instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.' He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. 'But perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; 'his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud. 'I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, 'till tomorrow--' At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him. '--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened. 'How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone. 'ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman. 'That's the first question, you know.' It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. 'It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, 'the way all the creatures argue. It's enough to drive one crazy!' The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations. 'I shall sit here,' he said, 'on and off, for days and days.' 'But what am I to do?' said Alice. 'Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling. 'Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately: 'he's perfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in. The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup. 'There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing. There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause. The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear. 'Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, 'why your cat grins like that?' 'It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, 'and that's why. Pig!' She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:-- 'I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know that cats COULD grin.' 'They all can,' said the Duchess; 'and most of 'em do.' 'I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation. 'You don't know much,' said the Duchess; 'and that's a fact.' Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not. 'Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of terror. 'Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off. 'If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, 'the world would go round a deal faster than it does.' 'Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. 'Just think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--' 'Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, 'chop off her head!' Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: 'Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is it twelve? I--' 'Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; 'I never could abide figures!' And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line: 'Speak roughly to your little boy, And beat him when he sneezes: He only does it to annoy, Because he knows it teases.' CHORUS. (In which the cook and the baby joined):-- 'Wow! wow! wow!' While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:-- 'I speak severely to my boy, I beat him when he sneezes; For he can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he pleases!' CHORUS. 'Wow! wow! wow!' 'Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. 'I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her. Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, 'just like a star-fish,' thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it. As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. 'IF I don't take this child away with me,' thought Alice, 'they're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind?' She said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). 'Don't grunt,' said Alice; 'that's not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.' The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all. 'But perhaps it was only sobbing,' she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears. No, there were no tears. 'If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,' said Alice, seriously, 'I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!' The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for some while in silence. Alice was just beginning to think to herself, 'Now, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could be NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further. So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood. 'If it had grown up,' she said to herself, 'it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.' And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, 'if one only knew the right way to change them--' when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off. The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect. 'Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider. 'Come, it's pleased so far,' thought Alice, and she went on. 'Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?' 'That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said the Cat. 'I don't much care where--' said Alice. 'Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat. '--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation. 'Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, 'if you only walk long enough.' Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. 'What sort of people live about here?' 'In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round, 'lives a Hatter: and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw, 'lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.' 'But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked. 'Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: 'we're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad.' 'How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice. 'You must be,' said the Cat, 'or you wouldn't have come here.' Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on 'And how do you know that you're mad?' 'To begin with,' said the Cat, 'a dog's not mad. You grant that?' 'I suppose so,' said Alice. 'Well, then,' the Cat went on, 'you see, a dog growls when it's angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.' 'I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice. 'Call it what you like,' said the Cat. 'Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?' 'I should like it very much,' said Alice, 'but I haven't been invited yet.' 'You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished. Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again. 'By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat. 'I'd nearly forgotten to ask.' 'It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way. 'I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again. Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live. 'I've seen hatters before,' she said to herself; 'the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.' As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree. 'Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat. 'I said pig,' replied Alice; 'and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.' 'All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone. 'Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice; 'but a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!' She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself 'Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I'd gone to see the Hatter instead!' CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. 'Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice; 'only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.' The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: 'No room! No room!' they cried out when they saw Alice coming. 'There's PLENTY of room!' said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table. 'Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone. Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. 'I don't see any wine,' she remarked. 'There isn't any,' said the March Hare. 'Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice angrily. 'It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,' said the March Hare. 'I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; 'it's laid for a great many more than three.' 'Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech. 'You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said with some severity; 'it's very rude.' The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAID was, 'Why is a raven like a writing-desk?' 'Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they've begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she added aloud. 'Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?' said the March Hare. 'Exactly so,' said Alice. 'Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on. 'I do,' Alice hastily replied; 'at least--at least I mean what I say--that's the same thing, you know.' 'Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter. 'You might just as well say that \"I see what I eat\" is the same thing as \"I eat what I see\"!' 'You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, 'that \"I like what I get\" is the same thing as \"I get what I like\"!' 'You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his sleep, 'that \"I breathe when I sleep\" is the same thing as \"I sleep when I breathe\"!' 'It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn't much. The Hatter was the first to break the silence. 'What day of the month is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his ear. Alice considered a little, and then said 'The fourth.' 'Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. 'I told you butter wouldn't suit the works!' he added looking angrily at the March Hare. 'It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied. 'Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter grumbled: 'you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.' The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, 'It was the BEST butter, you know.' Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. 'What a funny watch!' she remarked. 'It tells the day of the month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!' 'Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. 'Does YOUR watch tell you what year it is?' 'Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: 'but that's because it stays the same year for such a long time together.' 'Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter. Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. 'I don't quite understand you,' she said, as politely as she could. 'The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose. The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, 'Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.' 'Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to Alice again. 'No, I give it up,' Alice replied: 'what's the answer?' 'I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter. 'Nor I,' said the March Hare. Alice sighed wearily. 'I think you might do something better with the time,' she said, 'than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.' 'If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, 'you wouldn't talk about wasting IT. It's HIM.' 'I don't know what you mean,' said Alice. 'Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously. 'I dare say you never even spoke to Time!' 'Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: 'but I know I have to beat time when I learn music.' 'Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter. 'He won't stand beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!' ('I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.) 'That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully: 'but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.' 'Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter: 'but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked.' 'Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked. The Hatter shook his head mournfully. 'Not I!' he replied. 'We quarrelled last March-- just before HE went mad, you know--' (pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) '-- it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing \"Twinkle, twinkle, little bat! How I wonder what you're at!\" You know the song, perhaps?' 'I've heard something like it,' said Alice. 'It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, 'in this way:-- \"Up above the world you fly, Like a tea-tray in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle--\"' Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep 'Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop. 'Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter, 'when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, \"He's murdering the time! Off with his head!\"' 'How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice. 'And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, 'he won't do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.' A bright idea came into Alice's head. 'Is that the reason so many tea-things are put out here?' she asked. 'Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: 'it's always tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.' 'Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice. 'Exactly so,' said the Hatter: 'as the things get used up.' 'But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice ventured to ask. 'Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted, yawning. 'I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.' 'I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at the proposal. 'Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. 'Wake up, Dormouse!' And they pinched it on both sides at once. The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. 'I wasn't asleep,' he said in a hoarse, feeble voice: 'I heard every word you fellows were saying.' 'Tell us a story!' said the March Hare. 'Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice. 'And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, 'or you'll be asleep again before it's done.' 'Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the Dormouse began in a great hurry; 'and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--' 'What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking. 'They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two. 'They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently remarked; 'they'd have been ill.' 'So they were,' said the Dormouse; 'VERY ill.' Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: 'But why did they live at the bottom of a well?' 'Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly. 'I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, 'so I can't take more.' 'You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: 'it's very easy to take MORE than nothing.' 'Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice. 'Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked triumphantly. Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to some tea and breadand-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her question. 'Why did they live at the bottom of a well?' The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, 'It was a treacle-well.' 'There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Hatter and the March Hare went 'Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, 'If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for yourself.' 'No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; 'I won't interrupt again. I dare say there may be ONE.' 'One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to go on. 'And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw, you know--' 'What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise. 'Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time. 'I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter: 'let's all move one place on.' He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate. Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very cautiously: 'But I don't understand. Where did they draw the treacle from?' 'You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; 'so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?' 'But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to notice this last remark. 'Of course they were', said the Dormouse; '--well in.' This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it. 'They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; 'and they drew all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--' 'Why with an M?' said Alice. 'Why not?' said the March Hare. Alice was silent. The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek, and went on: '--that begins with an M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say things are \"much of a muchness\"--did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?' 'Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, 'I don't think--' 'Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter. This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot. 'At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she picked her way through the wood. 'It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life!' Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it. 'That's very curious!' she thought. 'But everything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.' And in she went. Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table. 'Now, I'll manage better this time,' she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains. CHAPTER VIII. The Queen's Croquet-Ground A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, 'Look out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me like that!' 'I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; 'Seven jogged my elbow.' On which Seven looked up and said, 'That's right, Five! Always lay the blame on others!' 'YOU'D better not talk!' said Five. 'I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!' 'What for?' said the one who had spoken first. 'That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven. 'Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, 'and I'll tell him--it was for bringing the cook tuliproots instead of onions.' Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun 'Well, of all the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low. 'Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, 'why you are painting those roses?' Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low voice, 'Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to--' At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out 'The Queen! The Queen!' and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen. First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS. Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; 'and besides, what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, 'if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see it?' So she stood still where she was, and waited. When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely 'Who is this?' She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply. 'Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to Alice, she went on, 'What's your name, child?' 'My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very politely; but she added, to herself, 'Why, they're only a pack of cards, after all. I needn't be afraid of them!' 'And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children. 'How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage. 'It's no business of MINE.' The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed 'Off with her head! Off--' 'Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent. The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said 'Consider, my dear: she is only a child!' The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave 'Turn them over!' The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot. 'Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else. 'Leave off that!' screamed the Queen. 'You make me giddy.' And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, 'What HAVE you been doing here?' 'May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, 'we were trying--' 'I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses. 'Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection. 'You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others. 'Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen. 'Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers shouted in reply. 'That's right!' shouted the Queen. 'Can you play croquet?' The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently meant for her. 'Yes!' shouted Alice. 'Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen next. 'It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side. She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face. 'Very,' said Alice: '--where's the Duchess?' 'Hush! Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered 'She's under sentence of execution.' 'What for?' said Alice. 'Did you say \"What a pity!\"?' the Rabbit asked. 'No, I didn't,' said Alice: 'I don't think it's at all a pity. I said \"What for?\"' 'She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little scream of laughter. 'Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone. 'The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the Queen said--' 'Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches. The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed. The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her head!' about once in a minute. Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, 'and then,' thought she, 'what would become of me? They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any one left alive!' She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself 'It's the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.' 'How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with. Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. 'It's no use speaking to it,' she thought, 'till its ears have come, or at least one of them.' In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared. 'I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather a complaining tone, 'and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming!' 'How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice. 'Not at all,' said Alice: 'she's so extremely--' Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, '--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.' The Queen smiled and passed on. 'Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity. 'It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice: 'allow me to introduce it.' 'I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King: 'however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.' 'I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked. 'Don't be impertinent,' said the King, 'and don't look at me like that!' He got behind Alice as he spoke. 'A cat may look at a king,' said Alice. 'I've read that in some book, but I don't remember where.' 'Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, 'My dear! I wish you would have this cat removed!' The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. 'Off with his head!' she said, without even looking round. 'I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and he hurried off. Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog. The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree. By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: 'but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, 'as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.' So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend. When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable. The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said. The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin at HIS time of life. The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense. The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.) Alice could think of nothing else to say but 'It belongs to the Duchess: you'd better ask HER about it.' 'She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner: 'fetch her here.' And the executioner went off like an arrow. The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game. CHAPTER IX. The Mock Turtle's Story 'You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!' said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's, and they walked off together. Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen. 'When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone though), 'I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL. Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, 'and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you know--' She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. 'You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can't tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.' 'Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark. 'Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess. 'Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it.' And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as she spoke. Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could. 'The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little. ''Tis so,' said the Duchess: 'and the moral of that is--\"Oh, 'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!\"' 'Somebody said,' Alice whispered, 'that it's done by everybody minding their own business!' 'Ah, well! It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess, digging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added, 'and the moral of THAT is--\"Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.\"' 'How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to herself. 'I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist,' the Duchess said after a pause: 'the reason is, that I'm doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?' 'HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried. 'Very true,' said the Duchess: 'flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of that is--\"Birds of a feather flock together.\"' 'Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked. 'Right, as usual,' said the Duchess: 'what a clear way you have of putting things!' 'It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice. 'Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said; 'there's a large mustard-mine near here. And the moral of that is--\"The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.\"' 'Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark, 'it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it is.' 'I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; 'and the moral of that is--\"Be what you would seem to be\"--or if you'd like it put more simply--\"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.\"' 'I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very politely, 'if I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it.' 'That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess replied, in a pleased tone. 'Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,' said Alice. 'Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess. 'I make you a present of everything I've said as yet.' 'A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they don't give birthday presents like that!' But she did not venture to say it out loud. 'Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin. 'I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel a little worried. 'Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, 'as pigs have to fly; and the m--' But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away, even in the middle of her favourite word 'moral,' and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm. 'A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak voice. 'Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke; 'either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time! Take your choice!' The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment. 'Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground. The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay would cost them their lives. All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players, and shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her head!' Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution. Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, 'Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?' 'No,' said Alice. 'I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.' 'It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen. 'I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice. 'Come on, then,' said the Queen, 'and he shall tell you his history,' As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company generally, 'You are all pardoned.' 'Come, THAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered. They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) 'Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, 'and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited. The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. 'What fun!' said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice. 'What IS the fun?' said Alice. 'Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon. 'It's all her fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know. Come on!' 'Everybody says \"come on!\" here,' thought Alice, as she went slowly after it: 'I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!' They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She pitied him deeply. 'What is his sorrow?' she asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, 'It's all his fancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know. Come on!' So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing. 'This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, 'she wants for to know your history, she do.' 'I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: 'sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.' So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to herself, 'I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn't begin.' But she waited patiently. 'Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, 'I was a real Turtle.' These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of 'Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, 'Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing. 'When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, 'we went to school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise--' 'Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked. 'We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock Turtle angrily: 'really you are very dull!' 'You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, 'Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words: 'Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it--' 'I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice. 'You did,' said the Mock Turtle. 'Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again. The Mock Turtle went on. 'We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--' 'I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; 'you needn't be so proud as all that.' 'With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously. 'Yes,' said Alice, 'we learned French and music.' 'And washing?' said the Mock Turtle. 'Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly. 'Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief. 'Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill, \"French, music, AND WASHING--extra.\"' 'You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; 'living at the bottom of the sea.' 'I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. 'I only took the regular course.' 'What was that?' inquired Alice. 'Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock Turtle replied; 'and then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.' 'I never heard of \"Uglification,\"' Alice ventured to say. 'What is it?' The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. 'What! Never heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed. 'You know what to beautify is, I suppose?' 'Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: 'it means--to--make--anything--prettier.' 'Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, 'if you don't know what to uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.' Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said 'What else had you to learn?' 'Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects on his flappers, '--Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawlingmaster was an old conger-eel, that used to come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.' 'What was THAT like?' said Alice. 'Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said: 'I'm too stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.' 'Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: 'I went to the Classics master, though. He was an old crab, HE was.' 'I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: 'he taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.' 'So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws. 'And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject. 'Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: 'nine the next, and so on.' 'What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice. 'That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon remarked: 'because they lessen from day to day.' This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark. 'Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?' 'Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle. 'And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly. 'That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone: 'tell her something about the games now.' CHAPTER X. The Lobster Quadrille The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice. 'Same as if he had a bone in his throat,' said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on again:-- 'You may not have lived much under the sea--' ('I haven't,' said Alice)--'and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--' (Alice began to say 'I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily, and said 'No, never') '--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!' 'No, indeed,' said Alice. 'What sort of a dance is it?' 'Why,' said the Gryphon, 'you first form into a line along the sea-shore--' 'Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle. 'Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--' 'THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon. '--you advance twice--' 'Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon. 'Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: 'advance twice, set to partners--' '--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the Gryphon. 'Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, 'you throw the--' 'The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air. '--as far out to sea as you can--' 'Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon. 'Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about. 'Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice. 'Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice. 'It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly. 'Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle. 'Very much indeed,' said Alice. 'Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon. 'We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?' 'Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon. 'I've forgotten the words.' So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:-- '\"Will you walk a little faster?\" said a whiting to a snail. \"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail. See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance! They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance? Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance? Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance? \"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!\" But the snail replied \"Too far, too far!\" and gave a look askance-- Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance. '\"What matters it how far we go?\" his scaly friend replied. \"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side. The further off from England the nearer is to France-- Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance. Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance? Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?\"' 'Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: 'and I do so like that curious song about the whiting!' 'Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, 'they--you've seen them, of course?' 'Yes,' said Alice, 'I've often seen them at dinn--' she checked herself hastily. 'I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, 'but if you've seen them so often, of course you know what they're like.' 'I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully. 'They have their tails in their mouths--and they're all over crumbs.' 'You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle: 'crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails in their mouths; and the reason is--' here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.--'Tell her about the reason and all that,' he said to the Gryphon. 'The reason is,' said the Gryphon, 'that they WOULD go with the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn't get them out again. That's all.' 'Thank you,' said Alice, 'it's very interesting. I never knew so much about a whiting before.' 'I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the Gryphon. 'Do you know why it's called a whiting?' 'I never thought about it,' said Alice. 'Why?' 'IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very solemnly. Alice was thoroughly puzzled. 'Does the boots and shoes!' she repeated in a wondering tone. 'Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon. 'I mean, what makes them so shiny?' Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her answer. 'They're done with blacking, I believe.' 'Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep voice, 'are done with a whiting. Now you know.' 'And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity. 'Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: 'any shrimp could have told you that.' 'If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, 'I'd have said to the porpoise, \"Keep back, please: we don't want YOU with us!\"' 'They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle said: 'no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.' 'Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise. 'Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle: 'why, if a fish came to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say \"With what porpoise?\"' 'Don't you mean \"purpose\"?' said Alice. 'I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And the Gryphon added 'Come, let's hear some of YOUR adventures.' 'I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,' said Alice a little timidly: 'but it's no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.' 'Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle. 'No, no! The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: 'explanations take such a dreadful time.' So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating 'YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said 'That's very curious.' 'It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon. 'It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. 'I should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to begin.' He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice. 'Stand up and repeat \"'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,\"' said the Gryphon. 'How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!' thought Alice; 'I might as well be at school at once.' However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed:-- ''Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare, \"You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.\" As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.' [later editions continued as follows When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark, And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark, But, when the tide rises and sharks are around, His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.] 'That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,' said the Gryphon. 'Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; 'but it sounds uncommon nonsense.' Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again. 'I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle. 'She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily. 'Go on with the next verse.' 'But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted. 'How COULD he turn them out with his nose, you know?' 'It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject. 'Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently: 'it begins \"I passed by his garden.\"' Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:-- 'I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye, How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--' [later editions continued as follows The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat, While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat. When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon, Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon: While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl, And concluded the banquet--] 'What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle interrupted, 'if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far the most confusing thing I ever heard!' 'Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon: and Alice was only too glad to do so. 'Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the Gryphon went on. 'Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?' 'Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,' Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone, 'Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her \"Turtle Soup,\" will you, old fellow?' The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing this:-- 'Beautiful Soup, so rich and green, Waiting in a hot tureen! Who for such dainties would not stoop? Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup! Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup! Beau--ootiful Soo--oop! Beau--ootiful Soo--oop! Soo--oop of the e--e--evening, Beautiful, beautiful Soup! 'Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish, Game, or any other dish? Who would not give all else for two Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup? Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup? Beau--ootiful Soo--oop! Beau--ootiful Soo--oop! Soo--oop of the e--e--evening, Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!' 'Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it, when a cry of 'The trial's beginning!' was heard in the distance. 'Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song. 'What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only answered 'Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:-- 'Soo--oop of the e--e--evening, Beautiful, beautiful Soup!' CHAPTER XI. Who Stole the Tarts? The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them-- 'I wish they'd get the trial done,' she thought, 'and hand round the refreshments!' But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about her, to pass away the time. Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there. 'That's the judge,' she said to herself, 'because of his great wig.' The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming. 'And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, 'and those twelve creatures,' (she was obliged to say 'creatures,' you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) 'I suppose they are the jurors.' She said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, 'jury-men' would have done just as well. The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. 'What are they doing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. 'They can't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun.' 'They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in reply, 'for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.' 'Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, 'Silence in the court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking. Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down 'stupid things!' on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell 'stupid,' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. 'A nice muddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!' thought Alice. One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate. 'Herald, read the accusation!' said the King. On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:-- 'The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, All on a summer day: The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts, And took them quite away!' 'Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury. 'Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. 'There's a great deal to come before that!' 'Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, 'First witness!' The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. 'I beg pardon, your Majesty,' he began, 'for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.' 'You ought to have finished,' said the King. 'When did you begin?' The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. 'Fourteenth of March, I think it was,' he said. 'Fifteenth,' said the March Hare. 'Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse. 'Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence. 'Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter. 'It isn't mine,' said the Hatter. 'Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact. 'I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation; 'I've none of my own. I'm a hatter.' Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted. 'Give your evidence,' said the King; 'and don't be nervous, or I'll have you executed on the spot.' This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter. Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her. 'I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her. 'I can hardly breathe.' 'I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: 'I'm growing.' 'You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse. 'Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: 'you know you're growing too.' 'Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse: 'not in that ridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court. All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers of the court, 'Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!' on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off. 'Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, 'or I'll have you executed, whether you're nervous or not.' 'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a trembling voice, '--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--' 'The twinkling of the what?' said the King. 'It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied. 'Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply. 'Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!' 'I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, 'and most things twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--' 'I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry. 'You did!' said the Hatter. 'I deny it!' said the March Hare. 'He denies it,' said the King: 'leave out that part.' 'Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep. 'After that,' continued the Hatter, 'I cut some more bread-and-butter--' 'But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked. 'That I can't remember,' said the Hatter. 'You MUST remember,' remarked the King, 'or I'll have you executed.' The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down on one knee. 'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he began. 'You're a very poor speaker,' said the King. Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat upon it.) 'I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. 'I've so often read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, \"There was some attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court,\" and I never understood what it meant till now.' 'If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,' continued the King. 'I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: 'I'm on the floor, as it is.' 'Then you may SIT down,' the King replied. Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed. 'Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. 'Now we shall get on better.' 'I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers. 'You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court, without even waiting to put his shoes on. '--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door. 'Call the next witness!' said the King. The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once. 'Give your evidence,' said the King. 'Shan't,' said the cook. The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice, 'Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.' 'Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, 'What are tarts made of?' 'Pepper, mostly,' said the cook. 'Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her. 'Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out. 'Behead that Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his whiskers!' For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared. 'Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief. 'Call the next witness.' And he added in an undertone to the Queen, 'Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead ache!' Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, '--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name 'Alice!' CHAPTER XII. Alice's Evidence 'Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before. 'Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would die. 'The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave voice, 'until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do. Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; 'not that it signifies much,' she said to herself; 'I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.' As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court. 'What do you know about this business?' the King said to Alice. 'Nothing,' said Alice. 'Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King. 'Nothing whatever,' said Alice. 'That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury. They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: 'UNimportant, your Majesty means, of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke. 'UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and went on to himself in an undertone, 'important--unimportant--unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word sounded best. Some of the jury wrote it down 'important,' and some 'unimportant.' Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates; 'but it doesn't matter a bit,' she thought to herself. At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book, cackled out 'Silence!' and read out from his book, 'Rule Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.' Everybody looked at Alice. 'I'M not a mile high,' said Alice. 'You are,' said the King. 'Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen. 'Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: 'besides, that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.' 'It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King. 'Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice. The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. 'Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice. 'There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; 'this paper has just been picked up.' 'What's in it?' said the Queen. 'I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, 'but it seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.' 'It must have been that,' said the King, 'unless it was written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.' 'Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen. 'It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; 'in fact, there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.' He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added 'It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses.' 'Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of the jurymen. 'No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, 'and that's the queerest thing about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.) 'He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King. (The jury all brightened up again.) 'Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, 'I didn't write it, and they can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.' 'If you didn't sign it,' said the King, 'that only makes the matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your name like an honest man.' There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day. 'That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen. 'It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. 'Why, you don't even know what they're about!' 'Read them,' said the King. The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. 'Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?' he asked. 'Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, 'and go on till you come to the end: then stop.' These were the verses the White Rabbit read:-- 'They told me you had been to her, And mentioned me to him: She gave me a good character, But said I could not swim. He sent them word I had not gone (We know it to be true): If she should push the matter on, What would become of you? I gave her one, they gave him two, You gave us three or more; They all returned from him to you, Though they were mine before. If I or she should chance to be Involved in this affair, He trusts to you to set them free, Exactly as we were. My notion was that you had been (Before she had this fit) An obstacle that came between Him, and ourselves, and it. Don't let him know she liked them best, For this must ever be A secret, kept from all the rest, Between yourself and me.' 'That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,' said the King, rubbing his hands; 'so now let the jury--' 'If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting him,) 'I'll give him sixpence. I don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it.' The jury all wrote down on their slates, 'SHE doesn't believe there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to explain the paper. 'If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, 'that saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye; 'I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. \"-- SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--\" you can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave. The Knave shook his head sadly. 'Do I look like it?' he said. (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.) 'All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself: '\"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--\" that's the jury, of course--\"I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--\" why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--' 'But, it goes on \"THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,\"' said Alice. 'Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the table. 'Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--\"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--\" you never had fits, my dear, I think?' he said to the Queen. 'Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.) 'Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round the court with a smile. There was a dead silence. 'It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, 'Let the jury consider their verdict,' the King said, for about the twentieth time that day. 'No, no!' said the Queen. 'Sentence first--verdict afterwards.' 'Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. 'The idea of having the sentence first!' 'Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple. 'I won't!' said Alice. 'Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved. 'Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time.) 'You're nothing but a pack of cards!' At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face. 'Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; 'Why, what a long sleep you've had!' 'Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, 'It WAS a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.' So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been. But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:-- First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister's dream. The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle. So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard-- while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs. Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life. Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org. Section 3.

Newby Chief Executive and Director gbnewby@pglaf.org Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://pglaf.org While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition. Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility: http://www.gutenberg.org This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

Introduction to Business Intelligence Introduction to Data Warehousing Features of Data Warehousing Introduction to Data marts Types of Data Marts Meta Data Why Reporting & Analyzing Data? The amount of data stored in databases is growing exponentially & databases are now measured in gigabytes(GBs) and terabytes(TBs). However row data does not provide useful information. In today\u2019s highly competitive business environment, companies need to turn these terabytes of raw data into some useful information . The general methods of analysis/reporting can be broadly classified into two categories: non-parametric analysis & parametric analysis Example Managers will generally be more interested in actual data and non-parametric analysis results, while engineers will be more concerned with parametric analysis. What is Business Intelligence? BI technologies provide historical, current and predictive views of business operations. Common functions of business intelligence technologies include reporting, online analytical processing, analytics, data mining, process mining, business performance management, text mining, predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics. BI technologies can handle large amounts of structured and sometimes unstructured data to help business & also identify, develop new strategic business opportunities . Identifying new opportunities and implementing an effective strategy based on\u00a0insights\u00a0can provide\u00a0businesses\u00a0with a competitive market advantage and long-term stability . Business Intelligence (Cont..) Business intelligence (BI) make up the strategies and technologies used by enterprises for the data analysis of business information. BI tools access and analyze data sets and present analytical findings in reports, summaries, dashboards, graphs, charts and maps to provide users with detailed intelligence about the state of the business. Typical BI infrastructure components are as follows: Software solution for gathering, cleansing, integrating, analyzing and sharing data. It produces analysis and provides believable information to help making effective and high quality business decisions . Business Intelligence (Cont..) The most common kinds of business intelligence systems are: MIS - Management Information Systems CRM - Customer Relationship Management EIS - Executive Information Systems DSS - Decision Support Systems GIS - Geographic Information Systems OLAP - Online Analytical Processing Introduction to Data Warehouse Collections of databases that work together are called data warehouses. This makes it possible to integrate data from multiple databases & it is used to help individuals and organizations make better decisions. A database consists of one or more files that need to be stored on a computer. In large organizations, databases are typically not stored on the individual computers of employees but in a central system (server). Data Warehouse (Cont..) A server is a computer system that provides a service over a network . The server is often located in a specific place with controlled access, so only authorized person can get physical access for it. In a typical setting, the database files reside on the server, but it can be accessed from many different computers in the organization. As the number and complexity of databases grows, we start referring to them together as a data warehouse. The ultimate goal of a database is not just to store data, but to help businesses make decisions based on that data. A data warehouse supports this goal by providing an architecture and tools to systematically organize and understand data from multiple databases. Data Warehouse (Cont..) According to William H. Inmon, a leading architect in the construction of data warehouse systems, \u201cA data warehouse is a subject-oriented , integrated , time-variant , and nonvolatile collection of data in support of management\u2019s decision making process\u201d. Features of Data Warehousing Subject-oriented Integrated Time-variant Nonvolatile Features of Data Warehouse Subject-oriented: A data warehouse is organized around major subjects, such as customer, supplier, product, and sales. Rather than concentrating on the day-to-day operations and transaction processing of an organization, a data warehouse focuses on the modeling and analysis of data for decision makers. Data warehouses typically provide a simple and concise view around particular subject issues by excluding data that are not useful in the decision support process. Features of Data Warehouse (Cont..) Integrated: A data warehouse is usually constructed by integrating multiple heterogeneous sources , such as relational databases, flat files, and on-line transaction records. Data cleaning and data integration techniques are applied to ensure consistency in naming conventions, encoding structures, attribute measures, and so on. Time-variant: Data are stored to provide information from a historical perspective (e.g., the past 5\u201310 years). Every key structure in the data warehouse contains, either implicitly or explicitly, an element of time. Features of Data Warehouse (Cont..) Nonvolatile: A data warehouse is always a physically separate store of data transformed from the application data found in the operational environment. Due to this separation, a data warehouse does not require transaction processing, recovery, and concurrency control mechanisms . It usually requires only two operations in data accessing: initial loading of data and access of data . Data Warehouse Design Process A data warehouse can be built using a top-down approach, a bottom-up approach, or a combination of both . Top Down Approach The top-down approach starts with the overall design and planning. It is useful in cases where the technology is mature and well known, and where the business problems that must be solved are clear and well understood. Bottom up Approach The bottom-up approach starts with experiments and prototypes. This is useful in the early stage of business modeling and technology development. It allows an organization to move forward at considerably less expense and to evaluate the benefits of the technology before making significant commitments. Combined Approach In the combined approach, an organization can exploit the planned and strategic nature of the top-down approach while retaining the rapid implementation and opportunistic application of the bottom-up approach. Types of Data Warehouse The three main types of data warehouses are: Enterprise Data Warehouse Operational Data Store Data Mart Data Warehouse Types (Cont..) Enterprise Data Warehouse : Enterprise Data Warehouse is a centralized warehouse , which provides decision support service across the enterprise . It offers a unified approach to organizing and representing dat a. It also provides the ability to classify data according to the subject and give access according to those divisions. Operational Data Store : Operational Data Store, also called ODS, is data store required when neither data warehouse nor OLTP systems support organizations reporting needs. It is widely preferred for routine activities like storing records. . In ODS, Data warehouse is refreshed in real time. Data Mart : A Data Mart is a subset of the data warehouse. It specially designed for specific segments like sales, finance, sales, or finance. In an independent data mart, data can collect directly from sources. Introduction to Data Marts A data mart is a simple form of a data warehouse that is focused on a single subject (or functional area), such as Sales or Finance or Marketing . Data marts are often built and controlled by a single department within an organization, given their single-subject focus, data marts usually draw data from only a few sources. The sources could be internal operational systems, a central data warehouse, or external data. Introduction to Data Marts (Cont..) A data mart is a repository of data that is designed to serve a particular community of knowledge workers . The difference between a data warehouse and a data mart can be confusing because the two terms are sometimes used incorrectly as synonyms. A data warehouse is a central repository for all an organization's data . The goal of a data mart, however, is to meet the particular demands of a specific group of users within the organization, such as human resource management (HRM). Generally, an organization's data marts are subsets of the organization's data warehouse. Reasons for Creating a Data Marts Easy access to frequently needed data Creates collective view by a group of users Improves end-user response time Ease of creation Lower cost than implementing a full data warehouse Potential users are more clearly defined than in a full data warehouse Contains only business essential data and is less cluttered Data Warehouse v/s Data Mart Data warehouse : Holds multiple subject areas Holds very detailed information Works to integrate all data sources Size (typical)\u00a0100 GB-TB+ Implementation Time\u00a0: Months to Years Data mart : Often holds only one subject area- for example, Finance, or Sales May hold more summarized data Concentrates on integrating information from a given subject area or set of source systems Size (typical) < 100GB\u00a0 Implementation Time\u00a0: Months Types of Data Marts There are three kinds of Data-Marts (DMs), which are as follows: Dependent DM : Created from a data warehouse to a separate physical data-store. (build over data warehouse physically) Independent DM : Created from operational systems and have separate physical data-store. Logical or Hybrid DM : Exists as a subset of data warehouse. (build over data warehouse logically) 1) Dependent Data Marts A dependent data mart allows you to unite your organization's data in one data warehouse. This gives you the usual advantages of centralization.\u00a0 2) Independent Data Marts An independent data mart is created without the use of a central data warehouse. This could be desirable for smaller groups within an organization. 3) Hybrid Data Mart A hybrid data mart allows you to combine input from sources other than a data warehouse. This could be useful for many situations, especially when you need ad hoc integration, such as after a new group or product is added to the organization.\u00a0 Meta data Metadata are data about data . When meta data is used in a data warehouse, that defines warehouse objects. Metadata are created for the data names and definitions of the given warehouse. Additional metadata are created and captured for time stamping any extracted data, the source of the extracted data, and missing fields that have been added by data cleaning or integration processes. Metadata \u2013 Example To Describe Meta Data of a Book Store: Name of Book Summary of the Book The Date of publication High level description of what it contains How you can find the book Author of the book Whether the book is available OR not The information helps you to: Search for the book Access the book Understand the book before you access OR buy it.",

TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO BE USED: - Hardware : Raspberry PI Platform: Linux Frontend: JavaScript, Vue JS, SCSS Backend: Python, Php, Config/Data: XML, JSON Scripting: Shell Database: MySQL, Server: Apache Server, Transmission Torrent Downloaded Pi \u2013 Hole NETRA \u2013 Mihir Image recog : Keras, Tensorflow Scene recog -> Pytorch Object Detection -> yolo, open cv OCR -> Keras, tensorflow, Open Cv Project Title: Netra: It is an optical electronic accessibility helper device for the blind people. Project Abstract: Netra (eyes) is a wearable device consisting of a raspberry pi and webcam designed for blind person and visually impaired persons. One can simply wear the device and then by pressing a single button the camera captures an image and performs various Deep Learning Image recognition tasks such image recognition, scene recognition and object detection. The best part here is that all the image algorithms will be developed and trained by us and we will not be using any 3rd party image recog( or 3rd party APIs). Services or pre trained models. Once all the image recog is performed the user will be able to hear the output using Text to Speech. Here also we will have our own proprietary algorithm and deep learning models for speech to text and we won\u2019t be using any 3rd party speech to text model eg. Google text to speech. The result of text to speech is also state of the art resulting in a natural voice (not a robotic voice) Also, netra comes with another unique OCR feature. With a press of second button an Image will be captured of any written document such as receipts and an ocr will be done of the image. The recognized text will be then read aloud to the user using text to speech. The best part here is the ocr accuracy. The ocr will be very accurate, so much accurate than the traditional widely used open source library \u201ctesseract\u201d. Our ocr algorithm will have an accuracy of 95%. Again, this will be our own proprietary algorithm and deep learning model. All the processing of the image recognition and ocr will be performed on the Microsoft Azure Cloud VM. Hence making Netra a IOT and smart AI edge device. ATRIS Project Title: Cross platform Desktop App to manage your personal knowledge base with audio, annotation and textual data.

PROJECT ABSTRCT: Security CCTV cameras have become more accessible to general public, but they don\u2019t have resource to assign a dedicated person, like those for banks and big offices to go through all that long footage, also storage of such long footages from CCTV becomes too difficult and expensive for normal people like home owners and shop keepers. So here CCTV-SUMMARIZER comes to the rescue, it Summarizes long hours of CCTV video footage from static CCTV into short video clip with all events occurring simultaneously with timestamp. Due to this the hours long footage can be watched in minutes and the storage space requirement is shortened significantly. The CCTV- SUMMARIZER works along with the web app so that the user can easily view the CCTV footage from a web browser. TOOLS AND TECH: Hardware: Web Cam, Raspberry PI Computer Vision: Open CV WEB APP: JavaScript, React, HTML/ CSS (FRONTEND) Python, Flask, Gunicorn (BACKEND) SQL ALCHEMY (ORM) SQLite (DATABASE) JSON Web Tokens (Authentication) UI/UX: Photoshop, ADOBE XD, ADOE XD Wireframing Kachra Seth(just for unique name and it can be changed) Project Title: An optimal AI solution for the local garbage collection problem automated. TOOLS AND TECH: Hardware: Web Cam, Raspberry PI Computer Vision: Open CV, Mask rcnn, Pytorch SMS Service: Twilio WEB APP: JavaScript, React, HTML/ CSS (FRONTEND) Python, Flask, FastAPI(BACKEND) MYSQL (DATABASE) Project Abstract: Our project is an AI automated project as per the view of smart city where there will be cameras connected to cloud as a backend where the main automation script will be running. Here our project will be IOT enabled edge device connected to a camera that can detect garbage thrown on roads in the camera premise using advanced machine learning and deep learning models that can recognize garbage, trained on garbage dataset. When detecting any garbage it will send the image of the vicinity with its geolocation from the device to the nearest municipal corporation whose distance is shortest to the recognized garbage pile location or the admin of the premises with twilio api as an SMS and will record the request in the database. There will be a frontend webapp displaying all the garbage requests of different areas in the admin side. We will make the request in the database flagged until it detects no garbage there. The main flagship point of the project is that it can be integrated on any camera whether its governments preinstalled traffic cams as well as local residential cams so its usage not restricted to Government level but rather than expanded to the consumer level too. Reward Cycle Project Title: Recycle and get Rewarded. Problem Statement: The issue is there people litter everywhere. Cleanliness is not strictly followed say it is a roadside or public place etc. On the downside even if people do put garbage in dustbin there are only a few who will put them in correct dust bin i.e. recyclable waste in recycled dust bin and non-recyclable in non-recyclable ones. People don\u2019t feel the need to do these duties as no one is going to reward them for there extra efforts. Project Abstract: A smart garbage bin heads-up system specially focused on kids and children where there will be a raspberry pi connected with the dustbin setup which includes ultrasonic sensor, camera, motion sensor etc. The chronology of the system is that a person will come near a threshold distance of the system and this will trigger our face recognition and our system then discover the person in front of it. The person will then point the garbage in front of the camera and through this our garbage classifier is triggered and will give the feedback to the user that whether the item is Organic or Recyclable and deep learning. These all haptic feedbacks will be given through led lights which will be showing the phase of the process. And after that through motion sensor in dustbin we will check that whether the person has thrown the garbage at right bin (in organic section or in-recycle section) or not and according to that feedbacks will be given and if thrown correctly then a reward point will be given to the person which he/she can redeem as a token of appreciation. So, the main motive our project is to give motivation to children to throw the garbage correctly into the correct bins and create an awareness towards them by giving rewards for their hard work and dedication and help them to strive towards home cleanliness.
